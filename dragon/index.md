## Prologue: The War

Amn and Waterdeep are at war. A great conspiracy was revealed that Waterdeep agents have been turning the oligarchs of Amn against each over for a very long time. Their conspiracy has now been laid bare and relations have soured to the point of hostility. 

Amn gathers its armies from all of the south, elephants from Calimshan, the finest archers from Tethyr. The so-called City of Coin has limitless ability to hire mercenaries from the far reaches of the known world. The oligarchs set their sights on dividing and isolating the northern lords. As luck would have it, Elminster hasn't been seen in a year nor has the lord of Neverwinter, Remevendr. Watedeep allies in the dwarven holds of the north report renewed hosilities with the giant natives. 

Amn has for centuries not allowed magic in it's nation and now, their antimagic research has come to another use. Great magical standards protect the Amnish forces from magic and it's proven to be a very useful innovation against the magic disposed Waterdeep forces.

To all, it seems bold in the least and desperate at the most. Many think Amn seeks to remove a chunk of Waterdeep's lands for itself. Others are under the impression that Amn marches to occupy Waterdeep itself -- many have tried but all have failed.

Laural will meet with you briefly to size you up. She is overseeing the creation of magic arms as an army of bladesmiths and apprentices work hand in hand in the mass manufacture of magical weapons. 

Laural has a problem. There is a red dragon that has decided to terrorize a town in the high mountains by the name of Elderbrook. The dragon is not known to her, but the town itself
