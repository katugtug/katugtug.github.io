Edges and Hindrances
Edge: (free) Flora and Fauna Edge from the GM

Major Hindrance - Bad Luck (Major)
Your hero is a little less lucky than most. He gets one less
Benny per game session than normal. A character cannot
have both Bad Luck and the Luck Edge.

Minor Hindrance - Vow (Minor) - 
Juvos the Faithful will never willingly act in disaccordance with the plan. He may shift his view of the plan over time as new info comes to light, but his adherence to the plan is ingrained into his character.

Vow from book: The character has a vow of some sort. Whether it’s Major
or Minor depends on the Vow itself. Some may have Vows to
particular orders or causes, to the Hippocratic Oath, to rid the
world of evil, and so on. The danger in fulfilling the Vow and
how often it might occur determines the level of the Hindrance.
Whatever the Vow, it’s only a Hindrance if it actually comes
into play from time to time and causes the character some
discomfort.

Minor Hindrance - Stubborn
This stubborn individual always wants his way and never
admits he’s wrong. Even when it’s painfully obvious he’s
made a mistake he tries to justify it with half-truths and
rationalizations.
