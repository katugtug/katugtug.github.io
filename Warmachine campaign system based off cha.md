Warmachine campaign system based off chaos campaigns 

Standard chaos campaign you have a company, which is 3 lances.

You could do the same thing with lists. Build 3 lists, you have 3 lance commanders that make up your company. You have to decide what you are going to deploy for the scenario.

Campaign system uses opposing forces sort of thing, you have one player as the campaign player. 

Things to spend WP on:
Allow salvage?

Healing stuff is PC / unit size / hp per unit * 10, round up
Barragers are 8 box at 10 pts, 3 models
10/3  = 3.333 / 8 = .416665 x 10 = 4.16, 5 WP to heal a box on a barrager.

Single wound infantry healing: 5 guys cost 7 pts.

7 / 5 = 1.4 /1 = 1.4 * 10 = 14pts to add back a single trooper,
It should cost 70 for the whole unit from scratch, so you can see its 56, etc. Works well with no fractions.

Jack repair is same, divide by number of boxes.

New units can be purchased by spending PC x 10 in WP,

Jacks can be refit with new heads and arms by paying the full cost for the head or army, i.e. a part costs 5pts, it costs 50 WP.
