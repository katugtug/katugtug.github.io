## Plot:

While drinking away their credits at a New Adjala tavern, some of the Leviathan crew picked up on a rumor.  

There's been an interesting sounding find in a remote cobalt mine on Vosloorus. A worker was moved off the mine after they found something and apparently, as soon as they found it, a Stimson duke came in to oversee the operation. But the worker, a Vosloorian named Mikael Beks, says they already got it mostly excavated, they are just waiting to load it up. An old ship part maybe? It's pretty big. The mining site is owned by a corporation, Estellian Heavy Industry and goes by the desigation Cobalt 340. What could be so  important that the royalty are coming out to endure Vosloorus and fly out to the middle of nowhere?

And apparently EHI wanted to get this thing off world for themselves, but word got out and now they are being forced to hand over whatever it is to House Stimson.

Well, Anson Birk and the TFL will load it up for him for free. 

The only problem with the attack is there is an naval station with enough naval autocannons to give any dropship a bad time in a hurry as well as a House Stimson Destroyer that can give pursuit. Any trajectory headed back towards the jumpship point will get shot to pieces. That means a jumpship wanting to avoid the naval station must either use the planet's shadow to escape detection and take a circuitutious route to the jump point, or avoid detection in the first place.

Given the remoteness of Cobalt 340, far away from the capital of the planet, all communications that would be relayed in a 750 km radius need to go through Radio Transmission Station Dingo. RDS Dingo is lightly guarded. If the station is knocked out, transmissions from the ground forces at Cobalt 340 will not reach the authorities in time for naval intervention.

The Duke, Leopold Stimson III, is here, but not even with a lance of his own Mechwarriors. It seems that the gravity of the find was not worth pulling them away from more pressing duties, stretched as thin as House Stimson is. But he did not come without some security and has requested the aid of a mercenary company that has worked with the House before. 

The contract is simple: provide security for the study and excavation of the artifact and provide for its loading and transportation offworld if necessary, a time period not to surpass 30 days. Standard hazard pay clauses apply to these contracts. Mercs get paid for every attacker they kill and have full salvage rights.

## Game Set up
* 2 mapsheets with the base in the middle. 
	* Base is surrounded by CF20 Level 2 walls. Walls are considered hardened for catching on fire purposes.
	* 2 gates, level 2 but with CF10.
	* In walls, there is a CF 20 building, the radio trasmission tower. 
* Defender deploys 2 of 4 mechs anywhere on the map.
* Attacker has the initiative. Attacker moves his all of mechs on from any edge. The opposite edge is now the defenders edge. 
* The defenders additional 2 mechs arrive on turn 2.

### Special rules:
* Fire and Smoke simplifed (BMM)
* Full Moon Night (BMM)
* All mechs equipped with searchlights that can be toggled on and off.

### Warchest 
* FLIR Suite: Attacker or defender +50 WP per mech:
    - Enemy mechs are equipped with a FLIR capability in addition to their searchlights.
    - Mechs can be equipped with sophisticated FLIR suite that allows them to count mechs as illuminated but without being illuminated themselves. Same range as searchlight. Doesn't help with the Reckless Maneuvering effect of night time.

* Minefields: +200 WP
    * Attacker only
    * Defender gets to place 5 minefields in secret before deployment. Defender writes them down and they are revealed with activated.

### Winning and Losing
* The game lasts 6 turns. 
* The attackers win if the radio transmission control room is destroyed. 
* The defenders win if it isn't. 
* The game is a draw if the radio room is still standing, but is on fire. It will burn down, but allow a radio transmission to be sent to the Vosloorus Free Miltia HQ. 

### Campaign Effects
If the attackers destroy the radio transmission tower quickly enough, there is a communication blackout for a big portion of the continent. This will disrupt all military and corporate communications until it can be repaired. This will allow a window for the attack on Cobalt 340.  

If the transmission tower survives, all bets are off and the fight goes hot. They have to take the part by force and then find a way to evade the naval station when the time comes.
