title: A story of ghosts
---

The hook?
The rats in the walls story. Below the house, a spring that issues forth from the afterlife and/or realm of dreams. 
It is filled with the bones of the dead.
Creatures that drink from it lose them selves into total oblivion, as the river Lethe. Some lose their memories, others lose their entire animus and their bodies become comatose.


- Elder mom in your family, great great great grandmother, loses her young son in a freak accident 
- Son haunts her in her dreams. She records these dreams. She has visions of him.
- He wants to take her to a spring in the mountains so she can drink.
- The woman disappears and is never seen again.
- Mining dries up.
- Uncle gives you estate.
- Estate in disrepair.
- 



One of the party member's has inherited a large estate and it's associated grounds from an uncle that they haven't spoken to in some time. The uncle it seems also had little time for the property and it has fallen into disrepair. In the letter, he grants you deed to the estate. It is yours, if you can recover it from whatever shape it is in... He scant details, but says that should you seek out Marie Von Klost in the village of Elderbrook when you have a chance.

The owner, short on options at the moment, draws the crimson wax stamped letter from its drawer and sets off to the manor.

Act 1: Arrival and Introduction

The first thing to notice is that the uncle hasn't been entirely truthful. While he claims in the letter to have never visited, there is evidence that he did visit last spring and stayed most of the year through, leaving in late summer, having come down with some illness. He took a carriage back to Lurzig. It was around this time he may have wrote the letter that you received in autumn.

The town of elderbrook sits on a large lake and a mill, currently unused, can be seen bridging the flowing river

Why would the Uncle lie?

    Marie Von Klost runs the local inn and she will fill the owner in on some local history. The mines dried up and most the people have left. The manor, built so the lord could oversee the mining operations, has been vacant for many years. Now the town of Elderbrook is slowly disappearing.

    Elderbrook lies high up in the mountains, and a fort with a small garrison of confederation soliders guard the mountain pass, the primary navigable road from the high mountain lands. The only way back is via the main road back into the low lands

Ground floor: 
In the manor, it's a dipadated house, 2 stories, with great tall ceilings. The shutters on the windows have been overrun with vines in some cases and broken open to the elements in others. Sunlight streaks into the drawing room, dusty furniture of a fancy make lie abandoned with the upholstry fading and dirty. There is evidence that someone has moved around some furniture recently, due to scuffs and dust disturbance. Some things have been moved upstairs it seems. 

Upstairs: Here the uncle, a year ago
