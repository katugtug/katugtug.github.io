# Session 2

The PCs have come to town for different reasons, but all will now be called into question.

**Recap**:
Met with a man in the tavern, the foreman, who explained that because of attacks, all mining has stopped and all miners have traveled en masse to the township for their safety. 

Met with Dyra, a wizened old crone in town, who knows of the history of the twisted root.
* Keziah fought against mines coming in with animal attacks. This is 15 generations ago, 300 years.
* Keziah was killed by paladins from the 7 swords of agor.
* Keziah, it is said, was a traveler beyond this world. She brought back something from the ancient deep sea kingdoms. The dreams of a creature there.
* Dream magic isn't practiced anymore like Keziah practiced it.

Met with head knight of the 7 swords, who refused to talk to people associated with the twisted root, but alluded to being here to "put an end to something".


## Setting the Scene


Evening has turned into night.

## Possible events:

### The arrival of **Viro Montaigne** 
An old dwarf and the Viro from Viro and Hoss.
* He pulls up in an expensive stagecoach with 3 high quality bodyguards.   
  * **Nathra**, female human warrior of a barbarian bent from the horse peoples. Hide clothed warrior with spears.
  * **Sonne of the Dales**, a spellcaster and adventuerer of some repute. Simply robed cleanshaven man with brown ponytail.
  * **Thrug Battlehammer**, a dwarven rogue and information broker. Black tricorn hat.
* He will hold court in the Chauncey from now on. 
* His motivation is to see the exports restored. He will pay the PCs to do so.
* His secondary objective is revenge for an ancient grudge against a beast in the mines, who cost him his clan name and the life of his 3 brothers.

### The attack of the beast, via the river at night. 
The attack of the creature will wound some of the Wolves of Cormyr, a mercenary company hired to guard the caravans. Most will retreat to guard to locations: The Chauncey and the Barge docks / warehouses / stables. Corporate interests.
Encounter: The PCs arrive to screams of horror as a great slimy beast emerged from the river and smashes into the tavern, crushing and hewing its massive weight through the miners. Everyone is running for their lives and the wolves of cormyr show up, but are unable to deter the creature. They will wound it to the point of retreat, but it will be up the PCs to ultimately deter it. 
Monster is roughly the strength of a black bear with a lot of HP for now, but will grow stronger.

Portents:
* A stench in the wind blowing from the north. (perceive)
* The miners are all drunk, laying passed out in the street.
