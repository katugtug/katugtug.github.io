# Session 2

The PCs have come to town for different reasons, but all will now be called into question.

**Recap**:
Met with a man in the tavern, the foreman, who explained that because of attacks, all mining has stopped and all miners have traveled en masse to the township for their safety. 

Met with Dyra, a wizened old crone in town, who knows of the history of the twisted root.
* Keziah fought against mines coming in with animal attacks. This is 15 generations ago, 300 years.
* Keziah was killed by paladins from the 7 swords of agor.
* Keziah, it is said, was a traveler beyond this world. She brought back something from the ancient deep sea kingdoms. The dreams of a creature there.
* Dream magic isn't practiced anymore like Keziah practiced it.

Met with head knight of the 7 swords, who refused to talk to people associated with the twisted root, but alluded to being here to "put an end to something".


## Setting the Scene
Evening has turned into night. The sun is fully set and the moon has come out. The miners parties have died down, they stagger back to their encampments. There is a stink in the air from the river. A number of guards in striped tabards stand around, guarding the cargo.

## Possible events:

### The arrival of **Viro Montaigne** 
An old dwarf and the Viro from Viro and Hoss.
* He pulls up in an expensive stagecoach with 3 high quality bodyguards.   
  * **Nathra**, female human warrior of a barbarian bent from the horse peoples. Hide clothed warrior with spears.
  * **Sonne of the Dales**, a spellcaster and adventuerer of some repute. Simply robed cleanshaven man with brown ponytail.
  * **Thrug Battlehammer**, a dwarven rogue and information broker. Black tricorn hat.
* He will hold court in the Chauncey from now on. 
* His motivation is to see the exports restored. He will pay the PCs to do so.
* His secondary objective is revenge for an ancient grudge against a beast in the mines, who cost him his clan name and the life of his 3 brothers.

### The attack of the beast, via the river at night. 
The attack of the creature will wound some of the Wolves of Cormyr, a mercenary company hired to guard the caravans. Most will retreat to guard to locations: The Chauncey and the Barge docks / warehouses / stables. Corporate interests.
Encounter: The PCs arrive to screams of horror as a great slimy beast emerged from the river and smashes into the tavern, crushing and hewing its massive weight through the miners. Everyone is running for their lives and the wolves of cormyr show up, but are unable to deter the creature. They will wound it to the point of retreat, but it will be up the PCs to ultimately deter it. 
Monster is roughly the strength of a black bear with a lot of HP for now, but will grow stronger.

### The Crones Request
Dyra will, after the attack, approach the PCs as they head out of town. The creature is misunderstood she will say, it is not a monster but an ancient being that has been wronged. It's dreams have been stolen from it, to return its dreams to it, that would end these attacks. Keziah's home is long since abandoned, but it was in the woods between here and the mines.

### The traveling monk
Brother Elba, a dragonborn monk, silver in complexion, will hail the PCs. He wears simple threadbare clothing, has a large pack on his back. He has come down from the mountains on a pilgrimage, to trade with the Tharn, a group of natives that live here. The monks require mushrooms for their spiritual brews, but where these mushrooms grow is known only to the tharn. The monks trade in worked metal, which the monks in their mountain monestary are experts at making. He has a bag of holding, filled with steel tools and weapons. He will greet Lakefire quiety. They cannot speak in the halls of the monestery, but can whilst travelling. There were 3 of them, but one was wounded and the other had to take him back. He decided to press on, but has become lost. He would be very helpful if he could travel along with Lakefire for awhile or if someone could help him find his way.

(Helping to find the tharn will lead to the standing stones, nearby which is Keziah's home. The tharn have abandoned this side of the river, pretty much ending Elba's quest.)

### The Silvertounge
The silver tounge is a coaching inn, primarily to trade out draft animals between bargetown and the township. It has a dining area and a big hearth and 6 private rooms and a large open area for cots in the main area. The proprietor is Drundar Horsebeard, an dwarf from an old destroyed clan in the Greypeaks. His is very concerned for his business if the things dont get resolved. He has heard squelching and chanting in the woods (Kuatoa finding something) but when he went to look, he didnt find anything but a few slimy scales and a bunch of webbed feet footprints. He doesnt know anything about Keziah, old folk tale, but old man Blevins might. He's a hermit lives in the woods, knows just about everything, but doesn't accept visitors. Hes got a big bear for a pet, Drundar says.

### Old Man Blevins and the Owlbear Ranch
Old Man Blevins is a half elf hermit who has lived in the woods for a century or more. He is friendly enough if the visitors bring a gift, but won't invite them in. Deckard Cain. He will talk outside, at a distance, where his owlbear pet can intervene if needed. He can fill them in on the location of Keziah's lair. His woods are also filled with snares and traps and alarm bells.

### Trying to find Keziah's House
Adventurers came through here a few weeks ago, brought Blevins a bottle of whiskey and he told them where to find the burnt out house. They left some camps and tracks and things. The PCs are following in their tracks.

Canvassing the area around the stones will take some time, but the house is nearby.

If enough time has passed, the 7 Swords of Agor will show up, just 3 of them. A scholar, the lady, and the rogue from the bar, leading the way. They will eventually find their way to the house.

The monster after enough time, led by Dyra, will discover the cave on its own.
