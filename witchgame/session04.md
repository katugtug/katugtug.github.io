### The standing stones

8 gigantic monoliths stand on a tall hill overlooking a lake, ancient beyond any measure, but ultimately quiet and still.
Approaching the stones, you begin to feel sleepy, drunk, time stretches out, the thought of the cool stone against your skin fills you with pleasure. The stones draw you in to touch them. 

Touching the stones, you fall asleep and dream of the valley, cloaked in mist and completely silent, the sun burns off the mists and Keziah is there, tall and noble with brown skin and great braids of hair falling down her back. She asks you to follow her, but you cannot. You are holding a glass sphere and in the sphere you see the valley and Keziah are both inside, miniature and small, a small valley lit by an unseen tiny sun, a tiny world contained in the palm of your hand. You awaken. 

In the hall below the hill, the watcher of the stones sleeps, his tomb is ancient and he only stirs in the moonlight to bring those from the circle into his tomb and bury them. 

Forest wights, guardians of the forest who have died when offerings were no longer brought to them, lie sleeping under the stones. They have buried others. There is one wight and 2 zombies.

### The lair

Burned out and hollowed from
