## The lair of Keziah
Keziah's lair is a dug out series of three underground areas, filled with the trappings of her witchcraft. Roots, herbs, vines, jars of small rotten things, all stay in jars upon the walls.

It lies in the basement of an burned out house.

### The stairs
The hollowed out hole has a single wooden ladder, rickety and mostly turned to rot. The hole is no simple cellar, it descends some 30 feet, below the weeping bedrock, into a smooth stone room. The hole opens into a cavern with knee deep water. Your feet splash as you disturb the water. You suddenly realize the water is seeming with snakes.
Spotted throughout the water, mounds of rock and earth are piled up, forming small islands. Dotted along the hewn sides of the cavern, wet with dripping water, are several holes. Many amphibious snakes are swimming around.

They slither around, but are not immediately aggressive. However, they have their eggs on the islands, and an especially big nest of snakes has formed in the rib cage of an adventurer long dead. His gear still lies there, gleaming in the darkness. Can they drive the snakes off to claim the loot? There is:
A suit of chainmail, 3 potions, a scroll case and a book. The book has the seal of the 7 swords upon it. This guy is no paladin, but he found the book

Once their nest in threatened, the snakes will become aggressive. Running away is an option. These can be very deadly.

The room exits through a great barred black door, but the door has fallen off its hinges and lies in a pile of wood. Very quiet footsteps can be heard in the far room with a dc 13 perception roll. This is the guard.

### The Lab
Water drips from above and trickles out of the long rotted door. The smell of musty rotting wood and a sulfurous stench fill the air. Hundreds of pages, rotted brown and decaying cover the floor. Bookshelves, 4 large ones, lay toppled on the floor. A great still, with a small chimney running into the ceiling sits on a desk. A long dead body lies decaying on the ground to the east, sprawled in such a way that it is clear she died clutching her throat. She has a small leather satchel still slung over her decaying shoulder. She is an adventuerer from the Sword Coast, here to loot Keziah's treasures. Her journal is mostly intact, its from 3 years ago. The book of rituals found itself to a Waterdeep merchant with some provenance, being among the possessions of a deceased former major of the Hindalew township. In the margins, some notes are scrawled about the sealing of Keziah Mezerine. They came to town a few years ago, asked some questions and eventually found their way to her home and broke the seal. Inside though, most of them died.


**From the lab, the players can piece together some of Keziah's work.**
- Orange rooted hallfeather - a type of leaf that drives animals mad, similar to rabies. Makes them aggressive.
- Waukeen's folly - a type of solvent, it ruins silver, making it unsmeltable and turning smelted silver to a green rust.
- Good old fashioned poison - a variety of poisons to make people sick.
- 5 tablets, each inscribed with a name. Cleanly broken in two. A gleaming chisel stands nearby.
  - These are old Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Amn family names. History; They are merchants, all in prospecting and mining businesses. Except 2, one an famous army officer, one a mercenary captain. 

Beyond the bookshelves and the dead woman, the room continues. Here a **humanoid mushroom with 2 arms** and 2 legs of white mushroom stuff and a bulbous mushroom head, purple with yellow streaks, walks back and forth against the hewn cave wall, guarding a passageway that leads north. In the corner of the room and all around the ceiling and walls, little purple mushrooms are sprouting out.  Two eyes can be seen from holes

Myconids are peaceful hippie mushrooms, who like the quiet. But this one needs to guard his spores which he has encrusted all over the inside of the 3rd room. He will offer the communication spores, that allow it to communicate with the PCs in an open palm. (for the creatures do not have mouths). He's like, "hey, you can't go up ahead man, its filled with poison spores". Take it easy, come back in a few weeks.

Things he wants: Safety of his spores, peace and transquility, source of food.

If they find a way past this myconid guard, they will learn he was not lying about spores. A field of green bubbles line the path, threatening to burst at any time. It takes acrobatics to tip toe through these or some other method. Con 12 or 1d6 damage

## The hall
The hall is Keziah's final resting place. Her skeleton sits at an old rickety table, water drips from roots in the ceiling, pitter patteriing on the table, hanging down at eye level for medium creatures.

On the table, **an orb** swirls with Keziahs final dream energy. A dagger lies rusting on the table near keziahs hand and the carved runes in the rotting tabletop can still be seen. A spell was cast. In the orb, valleys of green grass swirl around in a peaceful way.

All of Keziah's belongings are here. 
A number of magic items, mostly involving alchemy, potions, and traveling. She travelled a lot, probably has a Bag of Holding, other useful travelling gear, in addition to spells and scrolls that allow her to planar travel. She probably has a very powerful item that allows her to find her way in the multiverse, a Planar Compass, around her neck.

And the last item, another great orb, hidden away in a small secret place in the wall. It is the dreams of the great beast from below. Inside the orb, it is the blackness of the deep ocean. Tiny pins of red light and heat can be felt on the orbs surface. Visions of vast tunnels beneath the world can be seen, an occasionnal glimmer of light indicates speed - the dreams inside are roiling as in a fierce boil.

If the orb is broken, the dreams will escape. They will find their home if the creature is near, restoring the Underlord with his power and his bearing.
