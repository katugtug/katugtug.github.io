## The lair of Keziah
Keziah's lair is a dug out series of three underground areas, filled with the trappings of her witchcraft. Roots, herbs, vines, jars of small rotten things, all stay in jars upon the walls.

It lies in the basement of an burned out house.

### The stairs
The hollowed out hole has a single wooden ladder, rickety and mostly turned to rot. The hole is no simple cellar, it descends some 30 feet, below the weeping bedrock, into a smooth stone room. The hole opens into a cavern with knee deep water. Your feet splash as you disturb the water. You suddenly realize the water is seeming with snakes.
Spotted throughout the water, mounds of rock and earth are piled up, forming small islands. Dotted along the hewn sides of the cavern, wet with dripping water, are several holes. Many amphibious snakes are swimming around.

They slither around, but are not immediately aggressive. However, they have their eggs on the islands, and an especially big nest of snakes has formed in the rib cage of an adventurer long dead. His gear still lies there, gleaming in the darkness. Can they drive the snakes off to claim the loot? There is:
A suit of chainmail, 3 potions, a scroll case and a book. The book has the seal of the 7 swords upon it. This guy is no paladin, but he found the book

Once their nest in threatened, the snakes will become aggressive. Running away is an option. These can be very deadly.

The room exits through a great barred black door, but the door has fallen off its hinges and lies in a pile of wood. Very quiet footsteps can be heard in the far room with a dc 13 perception roll. This is the guard.

### The Lab
Water drips from above and trickles out of the long rotted door. The smell of musty rotting wood and a sulfurous stench fill the air. Hundreds of pages, rotted brown and decaying cover the floor. Bookshelves, 4 large ones, lay toppled on the floor. A great still, with a small chimney running into the ceiling sits on a desk. A long dead body lies decaying on the ground to the east, sprawled in such a way that it is clear she died clutching her throat. She has a small leather satchel still slung over her decaying shoulder. She is an adventuerer from the Sword Coast, here to loot Keziah's treasures. Her journal is mostly intact, its from 3 years ago. The book of rituals found itself to a Waterdeep merchant with some provenance, being among the possessions of a deceased former major of the Hindalew township. In the margins, some notes are scrawled about the sealing of Keziah Mezerine. They came to town a few years ago, asked some questions and eventually found their way to her home and broke the seal. Inside though, most of them died.


**From the lab, the players can piece together some of Keziah's work.**
- Orange rooted hallfeather - a type of leaf that drives animals mad, similar to rabies. Makes them aggressive.
- Waukeen's folly - a type of solvent, it ruins silver, making it unsmeltable and turning smelted silver to a green rust.
- Good old fashioned poison - a variety of poisons to make people sick.
- Twisted crows feet talismans.
- 5 tablets, each inscribed with a name. Cleanly broken in two. A gleaming chisel stands nearby.
  - These are old Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Amn family names. History; They are merchants, all in prospecting and mining businesses. Except 2, one an famous army officer, one a mercenary captain. 

Beyond the bookshelves and the dead woman, the room continues. Here a **humanoid mushroom with 2 arms** and 2 legs of white mushroom stuff and a bulbous mushroom head, purple with yellow streaks, walks back and forth against the hewn cave wall, guarding a passageway that leads north. In the corner of the room and all around the ceiling and walls, little purple mushrooms are sprouting out.  Two eyes can be seen from holes

Myconids are peaceful hippie mushrooms, who like the quiet. But this one needs to guard his spores which he has encrusted all over the inside of the 3rd room. He will offer the communication spores, that allow it to communicate with the PCs in an open palm. (for the creatures do not have mouths). He's like, "hey, you can't go up ahead man, its filled with poison spores". Take it easy, come back in a few weeks.

Things he wants: Safety of his spores, peace and transquility, source of food.

If they find a way past this myconid guard, they will learn he was not lying about spores. A field of green bubbles line the path, threatening to burst at any time. It takes acrobatics to tip toe through these or some other method. Con 12 or 1d6 damage

## The hall
The hall is Keziah's final resting place. Her skeleton sits at an old rickety table, water drips from roots in the ceiling, pitter patteriing on the table, hanging down at eye level for medium creatures.

On the table, **an orb** swirls with Keziahs final dream energy. A dagger lies rusting on the table near keziahs hand and the carved runes in the rotting tabletop can still be seen. A spell was cast. In the orb, valleys of green grass swirl around in a peaceful way.

All of Keziah's belongings are here. 
A number of magic items, mostly involving alchemy, potions, and traveling. She travelled a lot, probably has a Bag of Holding, other useful travelling gear, in addition to spells and scrolls that allow her to planar travel. She probably has a very powerful item that allows her to find her way in the multiverse, a Planar Compass, around her neck.

And the last item, another great orb, hidden away in a small secret place in the wall. It is the dreams of the great beast from below. Inside the orb, it is the blackness of the deep ocean. Tiny pins of red light and heat can be felt on the orbs surface. Visions of vast tunnels beneath the world can be seen, an occasionnal glimmer of light indicates speed - the dreams inside are roiling as in a fierce boil.

If the orb is broken, the dreams will escape. They will find their home if the creature is near, restoring the Underlord with his power and his bearing. 

Things in Keziah's lair:
- Evidence of 2 spells being cast: 1, a foul curse, black ashes and bloodstains. 2, the runes in the table indicate some form of enchantment, Keziah moving her dreams to the orb.
- Journal of her apprentice, Ezraban, now dead. She cast a curse on the knight she had stabbed. Mortally wounded by a witchbane blade, she put her dreams into the orb. Ezraban indicates he is going to try to escape. Its not clear if it worked.
- Simple sleeping quarters and under the rotting mattress, a key.
- Keziah's body. Maybe a key.
- A small secret alcove and that unlocks with a hidden keyhole. Inside, the bag of holding, a silver spear (+1 lycanthrope bane) and her spellbook, filled with powerful arcane spells and the secrets to reverse the curse that she laid upon the knights. 
- There is a way out here as well, though it is well hidden. Now that the seal is broken, it can be accessed. This could lead to the players approaching the fight from the other side and maybe even fighting a way to avoid it all together. lol weird. Either the beast or knights would win then, and pursue them.

At this time, a great rumble can be heard and the inhuman cry of the great beast. The clash of steel and cries of battle can be heard from the entrance chamber.

This is Algorath, Prince of the Deep.  Dark grey skinned torso, like the color of the deep ocean, fiery orange eyes and armor that looks like bright orange crab carapace. It is completely bald, with a flat nose and small mouth. Its eyes are enormous compared to human proportions, flaring orange saucers of light. 
Strangest of all, about its head float 7 shards of dark glass, each pointing at its face and moving around with it as it moves. It moves through the air with such grace and fluidity, that it barely seems to walk at all. 

- The knights fight the altered beast in the big carvern. The knights accounce that "its another one of those demons like we have locked up in magehold!" when they see schnapplehat. (future hook)

The players must decide what to do with the things they have found:
- The knights are here to find the magic book in Keziah's lair, not to necessarily seal it up. Give them the book and they would leave. It is of the most importance. However, when the knights are transformed into werewolves, they will lose all reason and hulk out, ignoring the book and possibly destroying it. It's a hard life.
- The monster wants it dreams back and if they are given to it, it can transform back into its true form, Algorath. Algorath as a beast can be killed, but when it is restored, it is of an obvious strength.
- The Kuo-toa can show up as well, they will aid Algorath and do whatever he wants. When he's in beast form, they will help him fight, possibly destryoing the orb.
- Keziah's dreams are the most dangerous. If released, they will wipe the Hindilew valley clear of life, mainly through the use of an avatar of natural destruction, the Darkness that Flickers. It will become a permanent and final manifestation of Keziah's hatred of the outsiders, driving them mad and poisoning the minds of those who come here. Hindilew Valley will descend into anarchy and be abandoned soon after. It announced I WILL FEEEEEEEED ON YOOOOOU and the valley is cursed forever.

The encounters:
over the clang of battle, it is very difficult to get a parlay going. Only after a few deaths there will be a lull in the battle that might be able to cause a cease fire. 

In the second act of this fight, some of the elder knights will hulk out and this will cause them to lose a lot of rationality (they will fight until all threats are dead). The 2nd act is a good time for the KuaToa to show up. And maybe for the sheriff to show up as well! 

The third act, the beast or the knights are chosen (it'll be beast lol)>> the beast takes the dreams and collapses into a catatonic state, absorbing the dreams. This part matter - if the knights win, they kill the beast. If the players win, the beast is risen and it just ends the fight.
