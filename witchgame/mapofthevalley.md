* **Hindalew Town** Situated on the main road leading out of the valley, this town serves to provide a last stopping off point as goods and people leave the valley. Here you will
* **Wagon destroyed by Koatoa** - A wagon has been destoyed by small fish like creatures. They scattered the silver all over the place like they were looking for something. Everything that was left behind was eaten. Koatoa tracks lead northward towards mines.
* **Wagon destroyed by the creature** - A wagon has been completely and totally smashed. The dead miners and convoy guards still lie around, pecked by crows torn apart by scavengers. Once again, nothing was taken. All the guards are killed. A miner or two escaped.
* **The forest** - a deep old growth forest of evergreen trees dominates a full 1/3 of the valley. It is largely unsettled, except for the occasional hunting camp and the like. Local folklore holds of strange people that live in the forest, but they don't come to trade very often. They keep the old ways, 
  * **The Ritual Tree** - A clearing with a great tree surrounded by stones. Examining the tree closer, the bones of a person can be seen beneath its bark, if the bark is removed. This ritual tree is for casting of powerful rites. It has been used recently. Tracks lie around, indicating someone has been here recently, 8-12 people. The stones, you notice, have been dusted off. The area, it seems, has been prepared.
  * **The Village** - Deep in the forest, you'll pick up scents of a camp and following those, you'll come to a small village surrounded by trees. Bountiful crops grow, a few individuals chop wood and work the farm. They appear to be mostly human. This is an enclave of the original inhabitants, they have some peculiar customs, but are generally welcoming. They will invite the party to eat and drink in the hospitality of their central hall. A great waterfall falls from a great cliff into the lake near their village, casting a great rainbow in the Light. 

* **The Chasm** - A great hole is the ground, it goes pretty deep, as far as you can see. The rock has erupted like a cannon shot from below. Huge chunks of rock lie scattered around. This happened based on erosion, pretty recently. The hole is filled with water though. 
The Beast came out of here as well as a bunch of KuoToa fascinated by it, following it. Evidence of both can be found, but the beast is enigmatic as its form is a mixture of various things, anathema to nature.
The beast emerged from here and travels some ways, changing forms at all times, until it reaches a half mile from the site where it meets up with a river and all of the tracks disappear.

* **Old Man Blevins** A vegan hermit who lives in the woods and talks often
