# Session 01

**Arrival** The party arrives by wagon, making their way to the Hindalew valley. Each searches for something independent of the others.

Kevin Strongbones, Halfling Ranger, fulfills a contract that was put into place by rival Amner silver mine. To burn down the Chauncey -- the seat of the Waterdeep silver mines power.

Rey, Elven Druid, sharing a similar mindset to those of the now mostly defunct Circle of the Twisted Root, Rey is driven to the Hindalew valley by a vision of a crow with twisted legs. 

Zuza, Half elf Paladin, 

Farthorn, Dragonborn Monk, returns to the valley after a long pilgrimage. He must travel through the valley to climb the high into the grey peaks, returning to his monestery home after being away for some time.

Schnapplhat, Tiefling Ranger, an ancient wizened creature born of the Abyss, seeks his twin, rumored to have traveled to the valley recently, so that they might join their tails together in some dread demonic ritual.

**Kevin** has a letter from the Blackstaff Mining Incorporated, 20 shares in the mining operations of the Hindalew Valley silver mines. The shares must be collected from the regional mining office. Kevin knows this is contingent on a certain deed that is yet undone.

**Miner furlough:** All of the mines have stopped producing and miners have flooded into town to spend what little money they have on wine, women, songs and such. There is a mine official who the party addressed: The mines are closed because of a nummber of attacks on the convoys carrying 

**Dyra Meeting:** Rey meets with Dyra, an old crone of a woman who is the last of those in the Hindalew town who keep the old ways. She tells Rey of the story of Keziah, how she stole something from the deep and used dreams for power, until she was killed by the Seven Swords of Agor, an order of paladins devoted to Mystra, Goddess of Magic.

**7 Swords In Bar** Rey meets a knight in the bar, while Farthorn blows the cover of another one trying to remain unseen. Two have been seen so far. Her cloak shows her to be a devoted to Mystra in some way, her sign, the 7 stars in a circle, can be seen there. The presense of Rey seems to agitate the woman into an outburst, she makes some veiled threats about "doing what must be done" and leaves the bar.
