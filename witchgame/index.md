# Preface
Dream magic - The scenario uses a type of magic called dream magic/onieromancy that is destructive to the Weave, the magical framework that allows magic to be used with relative safety. The goddess Mystra creates and protects the Weave. In the 2 instances the Weave has failed, there was a spellplague, a terrible time of chaos and upheaval, where magic had terrible and unpredictable effects. Continents were laid bare, sank below the ways, the sky caught fire, etc. Dreams in this instance are the animus of a creature. It's raw, creative energy, yet to be expressed. Mortals have relatively tame dreams, but the dreams of gods and elder beings are very potent; they are the source of their power and when stolen and used up to create magic, they can be a powerful catalyst and make the impossible real.

Mystra - The goddess of magic who protects the Weave and allows magic to be used. The Seven Swords of Agor are a paladin order of witchhunters who seek out those who threaten the weave. 

The deep sea immortals - The scenario uses the idea of a court of sea things deep below the ocean, going about their business in a parallel world of underwater goings-on. Hatched from the eggs of their forebearers in the deep sea, they grow to embody their natural aspects and then when they reach adulthood, they join the courts of their kind. They are functionally immortal and creatures of great power who can affect their whims into truth, at least in their deep sea dimension. They are unknown to the people of the Sword Coast, except for the folk tales of fishermen and the studies of the more arcane halls of Waterdeep.

# The topdown
300 years ago, the witch Keziah Mazerine walked the earth. Keziah led a group of witches, a coven known as the Circle of the Twisted Root. Keziah sought power to defend her people and accumulated many strange items to this end. In her travels, she stole the dreams of an infant immortal being from deep below the ocean and contained the god's dreams in a glass orb. She has many such orbs in her sanctum. Keziah may have had a plan for this object but its hard to say; it was stashed away in her belongings. The being has learned the whereabouts of Keziah's resting place and has now come to your sleepy village to get back it's dreams. Keziah was cornered in her home and sealed inside by a group of witchhunters and devotees of the of the god Mystra - the **Seven Swords of Agor** some 300 years ago. It's unclear what the crime was, but a magic seal protects the cellar of Keziah that can only be lifted by a member of this order or someone with a knack for rituals and access to their books. 

The beast wants its dreams back and is a powerful thing. They will need some help and a plan if they are going to defeat it directly. They may also appease it by returning its dreams, though only Keziah or another member of her circle would have known about the dreams in the first place. They could trap the creature, but it doesn't require food or water to survive, so it can stay in a trap for a very long time. At last, Keziah's own dreams can also be found, and releasing her animus back into the world would not resurrect her, but would allow her a final act before she disipates forever? What would that act be? Who is to say? 

**Keziah**'s lair may be found with the help of some sympathetic villagers, it's just a foundation now, covered in thick vines and all of the structure collapsed. Moving that aside, a cellar door can be found, but despite appearing to be a wooden cellar double door, it is enchanted and sealed by the **7 Swords of Agor** and cannot be opened by normal means, nor destroyed and it looks as if it were just made yesterday, outside of evidence of a fire. There is another way in that a good scout may find. Erosion has revealed just a hint of the cellar stonework that comprises **Keziah**'s home, some hundred yards from the home. This leads to a second entrance to the lair, unsealed by the knights, but inconvenient for the adventurers.

A number of Kuo-Toa have followed the thing from the sea and while they don't have any relationship with it besides reverence from afar, they do have a great fascination with the beast. They will follow in its wake, gather pieces of it that fall off, etc. The Kuo-toa are generally cowards, but may be driven to considerable valor by their priests in the right circumstances. They can add a bit of flavor and mystery to the proceedings; a group of fish creatures that murmur in the dark and appear where the beast has been.

The story is driven forward by the attacks of the creature and spotting of its Kuo Toa followers. Things the PCs need to know for the plot to render:
* the 7 Swords of Agor
  * A knight errant of the order has come to town to check on the seal and ensure it still holds.
  * One of the PCs is of this order and knows of the secrets.
  * One of the villagers, an old man or woman, is descended from one of the knights who was killed and still has his things, perhaps even instructions for the ritual, encoded.
* the Weave, 
  * Evidence of the spellplague and the night of blue fire will inform about the weave.
  * 7 Swords knights or other followers of Mystra 
* the oneiromancy of Keziah
  * An old woman who is a soothsayer who will read fortunes and interpret dreams.
    * An old tradition, very old. 
  * A man curses Keziah take you! as he is beaten up at a bar. A local curse.
* The circle of the Twisted root
  * Ancient markings in the wilder places, maybe even fresh ones to indicate that the circle is still active.
  * Villagers may still make offerings, old woman laying a basket under a tree at dusk. 
* The silver mining prospectors
  * The town has been shaped by prospectors and resembles other Sword Coast villages at this point. Silver mining is still going and export and started 300 years ago. "This mine has been a produced for over three hundred years!"

## The history of the Hindalew Valley
The **Hindalew** valley is a secluded valley near the **Sword Coast** area. The Hindalew people have been living there for at least a thousand years. It's not on any major roads and has attracted little attention in the past. Some years ago, silver was discovered in the valley and prospectors from all over the **Sword Coast** powers began to show up and make their bid for the riches in the mountains. The Hindalew people were split. On one side, they supported the new prospector's, the wealth they would bring to the region and a general modernization as they were brought into great Faerunian society. Traditionalists however felt that the old ways should be kept and that outsider's had little to offer to the Hindalew valley, who has remained independent for hundreds of years and should remain so going forward.

The traditionalists were backed by a group of spellcasters known as the Circle of the Twisted Root. They planned to make the it very difficult for the miners to establish a foot hold in the area. They poisoned miners, spurred on animal attacks and generally sought to sow chaos in the area to make the investment not worth the cost for the prospectors. They underestimated the resources of the prospectors from Waterdeep, Neverwinter and Amn. In retaliation, the prospectors hired guards and mercenaries, which attracted yet more private armies for hire from all over the Sword Coast. The leader of this coven was one **Keziah Mazerine**, a name that has been all but forgotten. 

## History of the Seven Swords and the Twisted Root
In the end, it wasn't mercenaries but an order of religious knights known as the **Seven Swords of Agor.** who sealed the valleys fate. Followers of Mystra, the god of magic, the Seven Swords had a religious obligation to stamp out magic that damages the Weave, the great tapestry of magical energy that tames magic enough for it to be practiced in relative safety. **Keziah**'s special brand of magic, *oneiromancy*, the magic of dreams, is anathema to the weave. And so the 7 Swords made their way to the valley to stop her.

In their first encounter, Keziah's magic proved too strong for the knights, one was driven mad, another reduced to ashes and another 2 fell fighting a great chaos beast that Keziah's dream magic had made real. The 3 remaining knights wounded her however, and she retreated bleeding to her home. 

They found her home, defeated her guardians and set fire to her home. In the smoldering ashes, they found an entrance to her cellar. Their numbers diminished, the knights did not have the strength to fight their way into Keziah's inner sanctum. So they called upon the secret rituals of their order and sealed her inside with a powerful spell. 

This plan would not have worked, except Keziah's condition, being bitten by a warded sword, grew worse and she died inside. Before she died, she put her own dreams into an orb. The creative animus of Keziah still lives in her sanctum, stored away for someone to find. It is alluring but dangerous, the magic of dreams is churning chaos given form in our material plane. But it's Keziah's will as well. Releasing it would give her some time and a form to do her plan before the energy dissipated into the world completely. It could also damage the weave, but no one is sure. 

## Immortals from Below

A note on these immortals. They are not gods, but they are of an outsider nature. Keziah traveled to the creature's home and crept in while it slept. The dreams of these outsiders are the source of their power. The dreams are their animus and creativity and strength. What she planned to do with this will now never be known, as she died shortly after taking it. Stealing them was an evil act, the creature is now doomed to never develop into an intelligent, living creature, but instead a hateful beast, bent on revenge and seeking. For hundreds of years, it has grown. The creature has lost its ability to speak completely, something it could do in adolescence. It stands 8 ft tall, but slumped over. Thick scales cover its body and great sharp teeth jut out from its conical, sharklike face. It can swim well and has a great tail that it drags on the ground, coming from the lower back, a fish's tail with fins. As an immortal of the deep sea, it has an innate ability to change its form and has an affinity for water. It has 2 legs and 2 arms in its true form, but can take many forms. In most cases, these forms are drawn from creatures of the sea -- sharks, crabs, jellyfish, eels, etc. It's always a mixture of these forms.

After the creature reached adolescence, when it would develop its place in the courts of it's kind, it instead began to devolve into a beast. It happened slowly and its search has been long, looking everywhere for clues of its disappearing piece, following a trail of clues that eventually has led it to Twisted Root coven and the Hindalew valley. Now at the end of its journey, it's reason has devolved almost completely. It is a wild thing, bent on revenge, but hardly sure why. In a few more years perhaps, it will die, unless its dreams are returned to it. 

It is a stupid creature. Much of its cunning has been replaced with savagery and its creativity was stolen. The last thing it remembers is the last thing it was shown before it devolved yet further towards beast: the symbol of the seal that holds Keziah. The seal of the 7 Swords. It seeks this symbol. It does not eat and has under-developed hearing. It can shapeshift into other watery forms, but prefers strong forms. It cannot be permanently killed by normal means, but it can be hacked to bits, where it will turn into a watery goo and sink into the ground, reappearing after some time. It is always slimy, leaving a trail of blueish goop whether it has been. While it doesn't eat, it's very frustrated. It will possibly attack and kill things that are in its way out of sheer animosity. If it finds the town and seeks something inside, who knows how many it might kill?

## Present day Hindalew town

The silver trade continues, silver ore is smelted down under the trade house of "Viro and Hoss" and exported via guarded wagon caravans back towards Waterdeep. Wagons of it can be seen leaving in drawn columns once every 2 weeks.

The sleepy town has largely transformed into a spot to house, feed and entertain silver miners. There are a couple different pubs, a single larger inn for more distinguished guests, a flop house / hostel for miner guests. There are stables and barn yards and silos, lots of grain for the horses is shipped in.

There isn't much for the outfitting of adventurers, but that which overlaps with mining. Pickaxes, backpacks, lanterns and torches are very common. 

Much of the old families have either integrated into the town in some way, or keep to themselves in the rest of the valley which is largely unhindered by the silver trade and remains mostly peaceful. Small farms dot the valley, with the people there generally under no rulership except the Lord Mayor of the township, who at this point is just and fair, but in previous times has been less so, especially the bloody history of the Twisted Root encounters here.
