## Events

### The lord mayor rewards
Thanking you for his life, thank god his family was away when the monsters attacked. He gives each player 50 gp as a reward for saving his life.

### Aftermath
After the players make their way back down the hill and into town, the great beast has slimed itself through the town, killing many guards and miners that got in its way. The monster has let itself back into the river, a great trail of blood and dashed bodies in its wake.

Viro and his entourage (dwarven mobster, greasy hair, heavy gold medal) is surveying the scene when the players arrive with a grim look on his face, sucking his teeth.

He will want to hire the players, 1000 gp to bring that monsters head back here. It's bad for business. If they agree, he will want to send two of his people with you.

If they refuse, he says the offer stands.

### Dyra

The old crone watches the scene from a near by alleyway. A sad time. The creature will not rest until what it has lost is returned to it. Keziah is to blame. 

While they are there, 2 of the knights of agor appear, 2 guys they haven't seen before. There she is, one shouts, and they make to subdue and tie up Dyra. The players may intervene if they choose, but the knights will warn of their considerable wealth and influence. They are english. This is your fault isn't it witch!

If you would check on Blevins, he might know the where Keziah's old house is. Maybe there is something there, she says, with a twinkle in her eye.

### The Knights depart
Mounting up and ready to go overland with a cart of provisions, the knights mount up on their horses. You recognize the older woman as the leader from the tavern, and the plainclothes man that rides next to her. One looks like a trapper or a hunter, a huge dog runs next to him. There are 7 total, possibly less if the 

The knights are following some intel they have on other attacks by the monster and they have found the general area of the problem, near the central forest, by examining the reports. Old man Blevins is a target for info as well.

## Places
### The Road 
The road north, setting out in the morning, the sun crests over the peaceful hindilew valley. The air is chilly, the grass is damp, the birdsong fills the air. The road north follows the river, oxen paths rut this side. Across the road, almost out of place, jagged rocks like broken glass stick from the ground, the spurned hills. Legend holds a meteor fell there some time ago.

A tower lies there as well, seen from the far shore, crumbling to pieces. Random encounters can happen on the road.

1. Miners without work, up to something. 
 1. Nefarious, theft, bullying.
 2. Good, helping someone out, with a problem, etc.
2. Old Man Blevins on a rare journey to town.
3. The monster, searching for something.
4. Kuo tao, collecting heads. Perhaps a lt of the leader.
5. Traveling monks from a mountain monastery, sent to trade.

### The Silvertounge
The silvertounge is a coaching inn, meant to change out horses and such. The knights will be here, sharing the fire, planning on leaving into the woods in the morning. There's no trade happening, so no other traffic.

The innkeeper is named Pip, a portly halfling.

The knights:
Alira - leader, paladin
Josiah - intel, rogue
tull - footman, fighter
baldur - footman, fighter
aly - footman, fighter
Anders - ranger

It is here that old man blevins (deckard cain) shows up, bald with a shaggy grey ring of hair around his head. He wears roughspun clothing and holds an old hickory staff. Around his neck is a small silver whistle.

He strides in full tilt, a wild look in his eye. He spots the innkeeper and hurries over to him and begins to discuss business in close quarters. Blevins has come to tell Pip to close up shop and get out of here. A great beast lurks in the woods, not just Boris the bear. He has seen it, finally it has narrowed down its search and its in the woods. Its an abomination. Once he has throughly scared Pip, Pip will head to the cellars of the inn, only to find that the kuo toa have burrowed in there and are erecting a shrine to algorath out of barrels and salt pork and dried herbs.

The knights all begin to sort of jostle for position if they are still alive, tull baldur and aly are in here. If only 1 of them is still alive, that one will try to discretely go for help. They want to question Blevins; his name is one that came up in their interrogations.

They want to capture blevins, which isnt great if he has time to blow his whistle. A 1000 pound bear will come thrashing into the hall. 

However, a fight will eventually draw the interest of the beast, who will come rolling in as the elder knights do. This fight will in general go poorly for the creature, alira, josiah and anders are high level ass kickers with a lot of tricks up their sleeves. If left to their devices, they will repel the creature, but not trap or kill it. 

The knights mission is to break the seal on Keziah's lair and clear it out. The record of the mission was stolen years ago (its in there now), so they have to locate Keziah's house the old fashioned way. Alira is knowledgable of their magics and has an idea what has happened here. Dreamless creatures have been studied by her order.

Blevins does know the location, but will not disclose it to any bootlicking city folk.
