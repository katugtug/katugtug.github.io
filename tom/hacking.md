# D6 Hacking Rules

## ICE
Cyber security is implemented via ice or intrusion countermeasures.

* code gates - seek to fry the hackers gear, removing the threat
* barriers - seek to stop the hacker 
* sentries - seek to kill the hacker, i.e. black ice.
* tracers - seek to locate the hacker in meat space
* dumb - doesn't attack back, just resists

Cybersecurity NPCs called admins can actively respond to hacking attempts in the initiative order by making attacks on the hackers console, forcing them to defend themselves as well.
Un-adminned ice only responds to attacks with reactions, i.e. the ice on every genelocked gun is not in the initiative order, but will respond to attacks when attacked.

ICE has a defense and armor, and for simple ICE, 1 wound is enough to get an effect, for example, to shut down a genelocked gun. 

ICE can have wound levels, with each level representing a further effect. Using this, you can have multistage hacks that take lots of cooperation and multiple turns to bring down.

When a hacker fails to meet the defense of ICE with their hacking roll, the ice retaliates by immediately rolling an attack roll against the hackers console. Depending on the type of ice, wounds from these attacks have different effects, see below.

### ICE example
    * **genelocked gun** - barrier - defense 15 - resistance 2D - attack 3d - damage 3d  
    * **civilian keypad door** - dumb - defense 12 - resistance 1d - attack none - damage none    
    * **military drone** - code gate - defense 16 - resistance 3d - attack 5d - damage 4d   
    * ** military power armor** - sentry - defense 25 - resistance 4D - attack 6D - damage 6D  (trying to hack military power armor without the right console will get ur head exploded)  

### ICE creation guidelines
Making up ice is just picking a difficulty using standard rules and assigning them "armor" and a "weapon", using standard equipment rules. Pick a type based on what you want the ice to accomplish. Sentries are rare, but obviously very scary. 

Barriers should have more difficult defense given their role. Wounds from barriers effectively raise their defense even more as they hobble the hacker. They are a wall, none get past. Barriers are used for top secret stuff. 

## Consoles
Consoles are the hacker's suite of tools and protection in cyberspace.

Consoles have different wound tables for each type of ice reaction. **When a hacker fails a hack**, the ice responds with an attack of its own. If it pierces the protection of the console, it deals wounds and effects based on the type of ice.

Consoles can have different types of wounds for this purpose and should be recorded separately.
### code gate: destroy gear: damage over resistance  
    1-3: stuns the hacker, -1d for all remaining actions and defend or retreat.
    4-8: console damaged, -1D to all actions 
    4-8: console severely damaged, -2D to all actions 
    9-12: console inoperable, DC 15 tech roll on console dies. if succeed, -3D on all actions.
    13-15: console broken. 
    16+ : console destroyed. Its trash and can't be fixed.
    code gate damage requires credits and tech skill to repair.

### barriers: stop hacker: damage over resistance:
    1-3: stuns the hacker, -1d for all remaining actions and defend or retreat.
    4-8: hacker delayed, -2D to all actions 
    4-8: hacker severely delayed, -4D to all actions 
    9-12: hacker lost, DC 15 hacking roll or jack out. if succeed, -6D on all actions.
    13-15: hacker must jack out.
    16+: hacker loses consciousness IRL and jacks out.
    barrier wounds can be restored by resetting the console, 10 minutes offline.

### tracers: seek to locate the hacker: damage over resistance
    1-3: stuns the hacker, -1d for all remaining actions and defend or retreat.
    4-8: hacker gives up location area, owner knows the hackers block
    4-8: hacker gives up console, owner knows the exact location of the console
    9-12: console tagged, ice knows location of powered console immediately for 2d6 hours.
    13-15: hacker tagged, ice knows location of hackers implant itself for 2d6 hours.
    16+: hacker tagged for 8d6 hours.
    trace wounds repair at the end of the encounter, but tags are permanent and must be waited out or removed by more esoteric means. The hacker does not know the duration of the tag. The cyberlink is directly connected to the central nervous system and shutting it off will defeat a tag with some nasty side effects, the least of which are nausea and clumbsiness for days or weeks. Shutting off a console is easier, but turning on a hot console before the tag expires immediately reveals the hackers location.
### sentries: kill the hacker:  damage over resistance:
    same as getting shot with a gun, you die of wounds.

### dumb ice: doesn't attack back, no wounds.

### example console 

sensenet dx-240 - basic street hacker toolkit, offensive
    passive defense: 10                      (use cybersecurity for active defense)
    resistance: basic (1d)                   (same as padded clothing)
    attack damage: aggressive 4D+1           (same as a long colt)

amazonia private detail bh-01 - elite security corporate hackers
    passive defense: 14                         (firewall = cover)
    resistance: good 3d                         (kevlar) 
    attack roll: hacker's hacking skill
    attack damage: 6D                           (rifle)
    bonuses: 
        security shielding - +1D damage resistance vs sentries
        incognito mode - +1D damage resistance vs tracers, ignore first tracer wound (i.e. take the wound, but dont give up hacker's block)
        automated annihilation protocols - console responds as ICE if attacked
            sentry type - attack as hacking skill - damage 6d
        hydra protocols - if the console would suffer a tag or give up its location (a 2nd or more wounds), roll a die. On an odd, the console explodes instead and the jacked in hacker must make a willpower 15 roll or suffer a wound)

### Making consoles
Making a console is picking armor and a weapon using standard equipment rules. Consoles may come with a Hacking bonus as well, or a hacking bonus in some circumstances, such as against sentries.  They may also come with a Cybersecurity bonus, to raise the difficulty of hacking the hacker's console.
