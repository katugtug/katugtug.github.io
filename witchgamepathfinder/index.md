**Elementals** - Mephits, 

### The circle of the twisted root
Dyra, an old druid and one of the last of her circle to keep the old ways, has taken to some of Keziah's old tricks. Animals can be compelled to attack by talismans crafted with old magic. Plants and animals of all kind can be made aggressive.
