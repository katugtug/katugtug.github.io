### Town Services
* Simple weapons and armor.
* Many provisions for travel, adventuring gear, things pertaining to mining, lanterns, etc.  
* Stables with horses, mules, etc for sale. Including a warhorse - key, one of the keziah adventuring party died and they sold his horse. A brevoyan charger.  
* The lord mayors home sits high on the hill overlooking town.
* The docks, where goods are moved to wagon caravans for the over land journey. Here also, Viro and Hoss offices.
* The mercenary encampment, where the Goldriver Company is camped. They guard caravans.
    - The merc company is here long term, they have weapons and armor and a smithy to repair and maintain arms and armor.
* The Chauncey, the fancy hotel
* The River's Way, the big tavern
* The hostel, a cheap place where miners stay.
* Farms, houses and other minor services.

### Potential scenes
* The players enter the town on their cart.
  * In the distance, the sound of revelry can be heard.
  * The party is on account of a great bear that the miners have killed.
* The players enter the town square and see a great revelry around a gigantic dead bear, bleeding a great pool of dark blood into the dirt from a cart. Some what out of the ordinary, a man with a jeweled pommel sword inspects the bear, Josiah, a member of the 7 swords of Agor. Seems to find something beneath the neck of the piece and put it in his pocket.
* The stagecoach of Viro pulls into town. The stagecoach is battle scarred. His entourage gets out and he goes into the Chauncey. The PCs can spot an assassin vine clinging to the bottom of the coach. If they do nothing, when Viro gets out, he is attacked and poisoned and the PCs will need to discuss matters with Thrug Battlehammer.
* The PCs enter the tavern and find the miners between a mixture of drunken rebellion and revelry. Thinking that their troubles are over with the great bear having been killed. They expect to be back to work soon.
* The party may spot an old woman, peering from an alley. She is as an old woman, Dyra she says her name is if people are friendly. A flock of crows rest in the heights of the alley, cawing noisily as she talks. A cry rings out at the end of the conversation, as 2 footmen come close, hurrying over. The players may be distracted but she turns into a bird and disappears. The whole flock takes flight.

### Secrets and Clues
* Keziah Mazerine was a spellcaster around here with a fearsome reputation. She was killed by the Seven Swords of Agor some thirty years ago.
  * Keziah's magic was dangerous.
  * She wanted to see the miners removed permanently from the valley.
  * From the immortal courts of the deep oceans, she captured a young god thing and stole away with it's dreams, such was her way.
* An adventuring party came through here, one young guy got drunk and chattered on about some book, some treasure, some witch. They set off into the valley right after the spring thaw.
* The last 30 years have been prosperous for the town, since Keziah was killed. There is an unmaintained monument to her death, down towards the docks. The 7 Swords put a stop to her madness. It's a bronze sword stuck in the ground, its been broken for years.


### The big attack
Encounter: The PCs arrive to screams of horror as a great slimy beast emerged from the river and smashes into the tavern, crushing and hewing its massive weight through the miners. Everyone is running for their lives and the wolves of cormyr show up, but are unable to deter the creature. They will wound it to the point of retreat, but it will be up the PCs to ultimately deter it. 
Monster is roughly the strength of a black bear with a lot of HP for now, but will grow stronger.

### In the hole
- In the hole, talisman, druids, Dyra. Magic.
- Bodies
- a live man, Orias, cocooned but alive.

### The township
The sleepy town has largely transformed into a spot to house, feed and entertain silver miners. There are a couple different pubs, a single larger inn for more distinguished guests, a flop house / hostel for miner guests. There are stables and barn yards and silos, lots of grain for the horses.

There isn't much for the outfitting of adventurers, but that which overlaps with mining. Pickaxes, backpacks, lanterns and torches are very common. 

## Encounters Tables

### The Creature
**Kua Toa** - Fish men who live in the dark places who believe they created the creature. They come in large numbers and seek to appease the creature by bringing it brains, mistakingly believing its wish for dreams as something else.

The creature itself, a protean beast of wild aggression is also around.

### The broken orb
In Keziah's lair, adventurer's stole the secrets of the knights of agor to let themselves into Keziah's tomb. In their deaths, an orb of elemental magic stuff has broken and spilled out, creating a dimensional rift between our world and a cyclic changing of various elemental creatures from the elemental chaos. Elementals and mephits and all manner of other elementals are emerging from the areas of the tomb that have the goo.


### The circle of the twisted root
Dyra, an old druid and one of the last of her circle to keep the old ways, has taken to some of Keziah's old tricks. Animals can be compelled to attack by talismans crafted with old magic. Plants and animals of all kind can be made aggressive. All around the valley, animals and plants are out of their minds and attacking representatives of the Viro and Hoss mining consortium.

* Assassin Vine Best 2 26
