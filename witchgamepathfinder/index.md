## Session 8:
Recap: PCs are in Keziah's lair, looking around, they find their way past a secret door into the ruins below. There are clay urns and roots seal the hall. As they enter, they come upon the remnants of the those who died fighting here, 10 zombies, 2 knights and a bunch of old townsfolk.

As they enter the next chamber, they walk into the Sanctum of Ezraban, the Keziah's apprentice and now somewhere between dreaming and reality. He protrays himself as dead, but he is not undead. Once the players have moved past the roots, they have entered into freddie krueger's nightmare basically. He takes on the aspect of the barrow wight that guards the tombs around here, but it is fantasy. His goal in this fight is to knock one of the players into dying and then inhabit them. This will end the illusion and Ezraban will not immediately draw attention to himself in the player's mind but will remain there until an opportunity comes.

The player's will have a better chance of survival if they realize they are asleep, where upon some of them will wake up, but they have fallen asleep just past the roots. The dead are still there as in the dream, but not zombies. And entering the chamber, they will find the body of Ezraban himself, blasted into shreds and a broken glass orb near him, a final attempt to harness a dream that failed and trapped his spirit here.

Ezraban's motivations are freedom. His spirit lives, but his body has been destroyed. Seeing they are capable adventurers if they wake from the dream, he will parlay with them, say he has misjudged them and tell them the story.

## Session 6 - My kingdom for a horse

Setting, mossrock woods, foggy, wet, dark, cold, misty, ferny.

Pulling a heavy chest from the inside of the cave, the chest will not fit up the tunnel.

### The chest

### Cave passageway
Long passage, hands and knees for medium sized.

Connects to a great cavern, stalagmites hang down. The cavern is illuminated by a red hot pillar of molten magma, dripping out of a high raised part in the roof of the cave. Fire mephits flit around here and there in the large space. The hole is the ceiling is some 40 ft above. A white hot ring of molten fire surrounds it, the heat must be extreme. This is a natural cavern with very little in the way of manmade tools. Pillars of rock reach down from around the hole and you can see from the glowing hot flames there appears to be a roof or something above. This is the first room of Keziah's lair, the snake room.

A pool of water gathers in the basin at the bottom. The water drains from the cavern in a small stream that the party can follow out and end up back in the woods at the foot of the standing stones.

There is a woman, Terestra the Mage, who has fallen through the hole fleeing the tumultuous encounter with the elemental orb.
She barely holds onto life. But she was there when one of the adventurers she was with shattered the elemental orb, the dreams of some untold creature were released, all 4 elements, complete chaos.

## Session 5 - Westward into the dark

At the center of the mossrock woods, a great spring pumps clean water into a great lake, bubbling out over great giant rocks.

The forest here is of a different character than the rest of the valley. The trees grow tall and broad and their needles cover ground and the sun is but a glimmer in the high canopy. Mist from the lake blankets the forest and the sun, high up and dim, does little to disipate it. The air is cold and thick with moisture. The rocks are slippery, the ground is moist and the plants are continually covered in dewy drops.

It is easy to become lost in these woods. 

Encounters:
* Tracks of old man blevin's great bear boris. Blevins is buying up all of the honey so that people cannot make sacrifices to the wight. 
* An old settlement and the well of the ancients. The opens up into old man blevins cellar which is fillllllllled with honey.
* The great standing stones on the barrow hill. 
* Refugees from Bargetown. They are being pursued by a band of Skum hunters. One of them is a hunter who can point the party towards the ruins of Keziah's home. The hunters can be evaded with a trap or a distraction. You meet the party at the bend of a 30 foot creek with tall trees on either side.

### The Barrow Stones

8 gigantic monoliths stand on a tall hill overlooking a lake, ancient beyond any measure, but ultimately quiet and still.
Approaching the stones, you begin to feel sleepy, drunk, time stretches out, the thought of the cool stone against your skin fills you with pleasure. The stones draw you in to touch them. 

Touching the stones, you fall asleep and dream of the valley, cloaked in mist and completely silent, the sun burns off the mists and Keziah is there, tall and noble with brown skin and great braids of hair falling down her back. She asks you to follow her, but you cannot. You are holding a glass sphere and in the sphere you see the valley and Keziah are both inside, miniature and small, a small valley lit by an unseen tiny sun, a tiny world contained in the palm of your hand. You awaken. 

Great pictures depict the moon at full and the offerings made here. Great jars of honey and nectar.

In the hall below the hill, the watcher of the stones sleeps, his tomb is ancient and he only stirs in the moonlight to bring those from the circle into his tomb and bury them. 

Forest wights, guardians of the forest who have died when offerings were no longer brought to them, lie sleeping under the stones. They have buried others. There is one wight and 2 zombies.

## Session 4
* Strong Start: Down by the river's edge, a wounded man cries for help as a number of fish creatures emerge, carrying a bag of servered heads and wielding a wicked knives and thick pointed morning stars.
* The man is Jermaine, a mercenary, wounded and dying. His was the last to get out of Bargetown before the fish folk took over. The whole northern valley is overrun with them and their gibberings to some ALGORATH. It's some god, they have a great pile of heads from much of the native folk and some of the miners too, piled high in Bargetown. They are building something underground at bargetown. Most were forced to flee but caught in the fish's traps and corralled for sacrifice.

### Possible Encoutners that are fun.

#### Well of the Ancients
In a clearing, a well stands and all around in the ruins of a former town, now covered in weeds and grass, everything gone but the rocks. One side of the well is carved out and bits of food lay there. Perception 25 to detect a seeing eye glass.
* The well used to be the home of a crazy dwarf who would trap folks in his traps when they neared the well. The hood of the well conceals a dead weight trap that drops a noose.
* The dwarf is dead however, admidst his many traps and such, the start of another problem emerges - elementals, a water elemental has made its home in the well, having been let loose by the spill at keziah's tomb. The water elemental will attack any who enter, but there are many treasures in this hole that the dwarf has collected.
  
#### Silvertounge 
* A curl of gentle smoke emerges from brick chimney of the The Silvertongue Inn. It is nestled into the trees just off the road. A coaching inn to change out horses and a welcome respite from the road. It's a timber structure, 1 story only, but real glass windows, frosted up with fog, as uniquely out of place. 
* It's a coaching inn, there are stables here.
* There is a visitor, old man blevins, out to get some honey and to warn his friend Pip of the incoming attack. Fish creatures from the north are swimming in the river at night and searching the forest for something.
* Just as he says this, there are fish monsters burrowing in the basement to get to the food and get some heads.
* Obvious exits from the silver tounge:
  * The great dwarven bridge, crosses the river to the west. The bridge stands tall after hundreds of years. Closed off by the mercs, but not any more.
  * The barrow hills into the forest of the east in Mossrock forest.
  * North to Bargetown, now overrun with fish folk.

#### Barrow lands and the standing stones
Dreams of another age happen in the barrows at night, midst the ancient stones from another time. A staircase to heaven and the kings of the hill men, savage and gilt with their blighted gold.

#### The Dwarven Bridge
Powerful stone bridge. Deep towers go into all the way below the water, there are 3. 

Barred from crossing by the goldriver mercs, great large people from the western forest and the spurned hills make their way in. The spurned hills have changed these people, men and women, making them larger and more aggressive, but able to bear the star seed, a silver mark upon their foreheads.
