## Session 4
* Strong Start: Down by the river's edge, a wounded man cries for help as a number of fish creatures emerge, carrying a bag of servered heads and wielding a wicked knives and thick pointed morning stars.
* The man is Jermaine, a mercenary, wounded and dying. His was the last to get out of Bargetown before the fish folk took over. The whole northern valley is overrun with them and their gibberings to some ALGORATH. It's some god, they have a great pile of heads from much of the native folk and some of the miners too, piled high in Bargetown. They are building something underground at bargetown. Most were forced to flee but caught in the fish's traps and corralled for sacrifice.

### Possible Encoutners that are fun.

#### Well of the Ancients
In a clearing, a well stands and all around in the ruins of a former town, now covered in weeds and grass, everything gone but the rocks. One side of the well is carved out and bits of food lay there. Perception 25 to detect a seeing eye glass.
* The well used to be the home of a crazy dwarf who would trap folks in his traps when they neared the well. The hood of the well conceals a dead weight trap that drops a noose.
* The dwarf is dead however, admidst his many traps and such, the start of another problem emerges - elementals, a water elemental has made its home in the well, having been let loose by the spill at keziah's tomb. The water elemental will attack any who enter, but there are many treasures in this hole that the dwarf has collected.
  
#### Silvertounge 
* A curl of gentle smoke emerges from brick chimney of the The Silvertongue Inn. It is nestled into the trees just off the road. A coaching inn to change out horses and a welcome respite from the road. It's a timber structure, 1 story only, but real glass windows, frosted up with fog, as uniquely out of place. 
* It's a coaching inn, there are stables here.
* There is a visitor, old man blevins, out to get some honey and to warn his friend Pip of the incoming attack. Fish creatures from the north are swimming in the river at night and searching the forest for something.
* Just as he says this, there are fish monsters burrowing in the basement to get to the food and get some heads.
* Obvious exits from the silver tounge:
  * The great dwarven bridge, crosses the river to the west. The bridge stands tall after hundreds of years.
  * The barrow hills into the forest of the east in Mossrock forest.
  * North to Bargetown, now overrun with fish folk.

#### Barrow lands and the standing stones
Dreams of another age happen in the barrows at night, midst the ancient stones from another time. A staircase to heaven and the kings of the hill men, savage and gilt with their blighted gold.

#### The Dwarven Bridge
Powerful stone bridge. Deep towers go into all the way below the water, there are 3. 

Barred from crossing by the goldriver mercs, great large people from the western forest and the spurned hills make their way in. The spurned hills have changed these people, men and women, making them larger and more aggressive, but able to bear the star seed, a silver mark upon their foreheads. 


## Session 3
* Strong start:
  * The protean monster ravages the townsfolk while a fire rips through the stately manor house on the hill.

### NPC
* Raicliff - Son of the lord mayor, studious, nerd, not a fighter. 30 something.
* Lord Mayor Hans - The landed noble, a count of the valley, his claim recognized by House Surtova and the other noble houses, he swears fealty to King Noleski Surtova.
### Possible Encounters

#### House Fire
* Manor house fire, the Raicliff is trying to save great tottering piles of books and manuscripts from the fire.
* Up the stairs, the fire rages in the bedroom of the lord mayor.
* In the bedroom, fish monsters roam, Kuo Toa, having hacked off the heads of a number of orgy goers, they now descend on the panicked and nude lord mayor. They scream HEADS FOR ALGORATH in their skittering tounge of fish croaks. Algolthus.
* The mayor will reward the party with some coin and a favor if they wish it.
* In the library of the manor, the learned can learn all about the history of the region and other lore.

#### City fight with Monster
* In the chill air of the night, illuminated by the pale moon, a creature makes its way from the river into the town.
  * Give everyone 1 mercenary guard with a torch and a sword.
  * The creature has AC 14, Ref +2, Will +5, Fort +8 and 100 HP. Each time it takes damage, it will spit out a sewer ooze. Fire doesn't make oozes come out.
  * If must make its move to leave, but it can make its +10 Melee attack 1d8 + 5 at any time. 
  * If the monster takes fire damage from a source, on its turn, it will move away from the source and try to stay out of melee with any torch bearer that has damaged it.
  * Torch does 1d6 fire damage.
  * In this way, they should be able to drive the monster back.
  * Shops around the square: Smithy, General Store, Tavern, Inn
  * Even if it backs away for 1 action, it can still attack. 
  * If they push it back 10 squares, it retreats.,

#### Meeting with the knights
* Perhaps morning after attack?
* Knights are mounting up, horses to carry a large cart filled with supplies. 7 knights in total. They bear the seven swords on some of their shields and finery.
* Alina will talk to the PCs. We're off to put an end to this problem and seal up the witch's lair from which all these monsters are coming out.
* They eye the druid suspiciously. We'll brook no interference here. Stay out of our way.
* They are headed up the road to the silvertongue inn.

#### Meeting with Dyra
* A pair of crows stand on a tall building, they catch your eye and you look below to see an old crone in rough spun clothing, hobbling into an alleyway.
* If you follow, she will converse with you. It is Dyra, an old woman, who has lived here for 80 years she says. 
* Dyra wants to tell the players to be cautious with the beast. It is not as it seems. She can tell you the tale of Keziah and how she stole from the underwater courts of these creatures. 
* just then, a group of knights come around the corner, and say stop right there witch, Alina has some questions for you she does!
* The party must decide what to do.

#### Wagon trouble
* The wagon below is overturned, and still has treasure. A number of local yokels are coming back to retrieve it, but you've ruined their plan.

### Secrets and Clues
- The Lord Mayor's son has different hair and mannerisms than his father.
- The seven swords have been asking after a group that passed through.
- The seven swords banished Keziah a long time ago.
* Keziah Mazerine was a spellcaster around here with a fearsome reputation. She was killed by the Seven Swords of Agor some thirty years ago.
  * Keziah's magic was dangerous.
  * She wanted to see the miners removed permanently from the valley.
  * From the immortal courts of the deep oceans, she captured a young god thing and stole away with it's dreams, such was her way.
* An adventuring party came through here, one young guy got drunk and chattered on about some book, some treasure, some witch. They set off into the valley right after the spring thaw.
* The last 30 years have been prosperous for the town, since Keziah was killed. There is an unmaintained monument to her death, down towards the docks. The 7 Swords put a stop to her madness. It's a bronze sword stuck in the ground, its been broken for years.

### Fantastic Locations
* The road out of town is run deep with wagon wheels and over grown with tall spring grass. You can see the hazy ridges of the distant mountains in the morning sun. It's cold at night, but quickly warms up during the day. There is an ox path, but no oxen in sight. The poor road, not yet filled in after the thaw, is the only real way deeper into the valley. 
* From a distance, you can see the shape of another wagon, this one much larger, requiring perhaps 8 horses to pull over the rough road. High boards on the top of the structure would have provided cover from a traditional attack, but the whole thing has been pitched over on its side, probably rendering the defense useless. A great boulder stained with dark brown blood shows that a bloody fight happened here. Broken boards, bits of bridle and straps, broken arrow shafts and shattered weapons are all that remain. Tracks lead to and fro; someone has scavenged many of the valuables. 
  - A gold river mercenary did escape, wounded, and died down by the river. You can follow his trail to there. 
* A curl of gentle smoke emerges from brick chimney of the The Silvertongue Inn. It is nestled into the trees just off the road. A coaching inn to change out horses and a welcome respite from the road. It's a timber structure, 1 story only, but real glass windows, frosted up with fog, as uniquely out of place.

* Stables with horses, mules, etc for sale. Including a warhorse - key, one of the keziah adventuring party died and they sold his horse. A brevoyan charger.  
* The lord mayors home sits high on the hill overlooking town.
* The docks, where goods are moved to wagon caravans for the over land journey. Here also, Viro and Hoss offices.

* The Chauncey, the fancy hotel
* The River's Way, the big tavern
* The hostel, a cheap place where miners stay.
* Farms, houses and other minor services.

### Potential scenes
* The players enter the town on their cart.
  * In the distance, the sound of revelry can be heard.
  * The party is on account of a great bear that the miners have killed.
* The players enter the town square and see a great revelry around a gigantic dead bear, bleeding a great pool of dark blood into the dirt from a cart. Some what out of the ordinary, a man with a jeweled pommel sword inspects the bear, Josiah, a member of the 7 swords of Agor. Seems to find something beneath the neck of the piece and put it in his pocket.
* The stagecoach of Viro pulls into town. The stagecoach is battle scarred. His entourage gets out and he goes into the Chauncey. The PCs can spot an assassin vine clinging to the bottom of the coach. If they do nothing, when Viro gets out, he is attacked and poisoned and the PCs will need to discuss matters with Thrug Battlehammer.
* The PCs enter the tavern and find the miners between a mixture of drunken rebellion and revelry. Thinking that their troubles are over with the great bear having been killed. They expect to be back to work soon.
* The party may spot an old woman, peering from an alley. She is as an old woman, Dyra she says her name is if people are friendly. A flock of crows rest in the heights of the alley, cawing noisily as she talks. A cry rings out at the end of the conversation, as 2 footmen come close, hurrying over. The players may be distracted but she turns into a bird and disappears. The whole flock takes flight.

### Secrets and Clues
* Keziah Mazerine was a spellcaster around here with a fearsome reputation. She was killed by the Seven Swords of Agor some thirty years ago.
  * Keziah's magic was dangerous.
  * She wanted to see the miners removed permanently from the valley.
  * From the immortal courts of the deep oceans, she captured a young god thing and stole away with it's dreams, such was her way.

### The big attack
Encounter: The PCs arrive to screams of horror as a great slimy beast emerged from the river and smashes into the tavern, crushing and hewing its massive weight through the miners. Everyone is running for their lives and the wolves of cormyr show up, but are unable to deter the creature. They will wound it to the point of retreat, but it will be up the PCs to ultimately deter it. 
Monster is roughly the strength of a black bear with a lot of HP for now, but will grow stronger.

### In the hole
- In the hole, talisman, druids, Dyra. Magic.
- Bodies
- a live man, Orias, cocooned but alive.

### The township
The sleepy town has largely transformed into a spot to house, feed and entertain silver miners. There are a couple different pubs, a single larger inn for more distinguished guests, a flop house / hostel for miner guests. There are stables and barn yards and silos, lots of grain for the horses.

There isn't much for the outfitting of adventurers, but that which overlaps with mining. Pickaxes, backpacks, lanterns and torches are very common. 

## Encounters Tables

### The Creature
**Kua Toa** - Fish men who live in the dark places who believe they created the creature. They come in large numbers and seek to appease the creature by bringing it brains, mistakingly believing its wish for dreams as something else.

The creature itself, a protean beast of wild aggression is also around.

### The broken orb
In Keziah's lair, adventurer's stole the secrets of the knights of agor to let themselves into Keziah's tomb. In their deaths, an orb of elemental magic stuff has broken and spilled out, creating a dimensional rift between our world and a cyclic changing of various elemental creatures from the elemental chaos. Elementals and mephits and all manner of other elementals are emerging from the areas of the tomb that have the goo.


### The circle of the twisted root
Dyra, an old druid and one of the last of her circle to keep the old ways, has taken to some of Keziah's old tricks. Animals can be compelled to attack by talismans crafted with old magic. Plants and animals of all kind can be made aggressive. All around the valley, animals and plants are out of their minds and attacking representatives of the Viro and Hoss mining consortium.
