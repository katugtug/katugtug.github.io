Infernal Wound (divine, necromancy) A bearded devilâ€™s glaive Strike also deals 1d6 persistent bleed damage that resists attempts to heal it. The flat check to stop the bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery. The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item attempting to use healing magic on a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 21 counteract check or the magic fails to heal the creature.

Cannot be slain, but loses an action from -60 to 0, 2 actions at -120 to -60 and all 3 actions at less than -120 hp. Removing the katana while he is incapacitated releases the demon from the blade but free's Akihiro's soul (to be judged harshly by his ancestors)
