### Overview:
Party emerges from bee dungeon but are being followed by the huntsworn group, who pursues them into the gnome city and its locations. The party must find a way out of the city while not getting caught by the huntsworn or delay until Virgoth and his black riders arrive, it should be soon.


### Huntsworn hunting party
After party comes out of bee dungeon and are chatting with the other party of adventurers, the hunt sworn are spotted making their way toward the statue. Disguised as a tall man with a big hood is one of the iron golems. They are following the trail of the party and it dead ends at the gnome statue. They are looking around.

Eventually, they will start teleporting into the bee dungeon and eventually after that, Akihiro will emerge where the PCs are, as well as the rest of the huntsworn. 

The party is set up 50 yards from the statue and starts unseen. 

Things to do: 
* Get the other adventurers to help. They want money or an appeal to their higher purpose. But mostly money. They all have debts.
* The technic league sorcerer is nearby, having escaped. 
* Akihiro will emerge where the players are, out of breath and wounded.
* Virgoth and his entourage will arrive riding magical motorbikes, the "black horses". 

Technic League Arcane Trickster Malvus the Munificent (he's generous for he steals your gold, but leaves you a better story! lol)
He's a rogue / gadgeteer. He's got lots of tricks up his sleeves.
He is working for the technic league, but will not reveal this. He portrays himself as a traveler who was captured by the barbarians. Its merely a coincidence that they mistook him for a vexgit, he was working on a prototype armor. He's out here looking for technology just like everyone else, until those barbarians snapped a trap on him.

The party will find that the city is teeming with groups of huntsworn that are looking for them. They are commanded by the hooded man. They are directed to find the elf with the wooden mask and get the keys. They are commanded by the staples in their necks. If they staples are removed, there is a change they will recover their memories after a brief catatonia. Sometimes they will not (1 in 6) if the staple is crudely removed. Among the huntsworn is the android from the lightspear tribe. It is his memories that told them what direction the party might be heading.

The dry barren wastelands that surround the city are bare to see. You are basically out in the open. Because of this, the all will see virgoth's approaching bikes long before they arrive, several hours.


# Gnome City
What happened here?
Starfall introduced toxic leakage into roots of tree that over the centuries have withered it. The gnomes here relied on the sentient tree they called the Great Boba. In an effort to save the tree, they treated it with blessings and tinctures of a fey variety and its roots began to grow into the First World. But then the effort reversed itself, the roots growing into the First World dried up and the great tree began "bleaching", its leaves turned white and its bark to ashes and it will soon be completely dead except for a few leaves at the very top.
## The big tree (center of map)
- Gigantic imposing unhealthy tree.
- A gray gnome falls at your feet, apparnetly dead.
- There used to be great ladders and lifts to climb it, but those have fallen to ruin.
- it can be climbed however
- Lower boughs, many abandoned dwellings have been looted, but one hollow into the tree is hidden and revealed, A dwelling, 20x30, with the trappings of homelife, but the lanterns flicker and shift as you enter and a cold wind blows. There is a chest on the far side of the room.
- Upper boughs remain inhabited by the last of the gnomes, many bleached and dispondant, they are languid and bored except for one, Fisseedi the collector, who has been collecting all of the curios from his friends and family as they pass. He'll trade with you if you'd like, but he cannot guarantee the exact qualities of the items he gives you.
  - There is a great hang glider here.
  - He has no clue about how to do much for the tree.
  - He can show you the gliders if you'd like, there are a great many hanggliders here. He hasnt used them in awhile, so he's not sure if they still work. But he's thinking it probably time.
- There is a chance the hangglider will malfunction and send you to an odd part of the city below, but there's also a chance it'll get you out of the city for good in a random direction.
- Fisseedi the collector is Malvus the Munificient in disguise! He was up here looking away, when the pcs came.
- A hard to find cache has Malvus' old suit that looks like a vexgit, discarded.


## Armoury
It looks like an armoury from the outside with heavy doors and a thick wall around it. But the wall is crumbled and inside its actually a central repository for nice tools.
Like most of the buildings, there is a small garden here, all of dead weeds, and a scarecrow, its old stuffed coat falling apart in the wind.
It looks like this place was mostly cleared out by the leaving gnomes when they went and the tools are sized for 3 ft tall gnomes. A few remain but their bizarre whimsome shapes are not like any tools you've encountered. A great sign indicates 'dibbers'. Nearby, dabbers, dotters and dubbers are to be kept. High rafters are way up there, tall ceilings and great walls of small tools that have no good use. In the rafters, a small chest of valuables can be found. There's a bundle of not often used stuff up here.
A broad sack is tied up in the corner. inside is a dig-widget. A dog like construct with corkscrews for legs and drills for hands. it's head is a number of odd tools.
The spirit of a ghostly gnome gardner sits on the rafters if you climb into the loft.
- What ya doing with me things?
- Little fella tool me tools before I noticed, but you lumberfoots i heard well away.
- Get away from my things ya louts!

## Church of She Who Guides the Wind and the Waves
The great temple to She Who Guides the Wind and the Waves, lies over a great reflecting pool, now dried and barren.

There a signs of life here, but no one seems to watch you as you approach.
