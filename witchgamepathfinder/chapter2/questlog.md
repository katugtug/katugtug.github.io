## Quest Log

### The Great Hunt
* The party seeks audience with Virgoth, leader of the Black Horse tribe. A number of vexgits have been persuaded to show up near Crowhollow in a fortnight. Virgoth seeks vexgits to give him an edge as he plans to strike at the technic league who control the richest lands in Numeria.

* The party met a few Blackhorse tribespeople. Ulidar, who wants to bring the party to Virgoth and Doren, who thinks involving the party in tribe business is a bad idea. They had in their possession a "vexgit" that they trapped. But the party found real vexgits who are dissimilar in many ways. That vexgit is something else in a costume.

* Mysterious metal men cast from dark bronze have invaded the Hindalew Valley, announcing their arrival as the beginning of the great hunt and promising an end to the age of men. Their arrival was accompanied by darkness and silence and they began wholesale slaughter of the inhabitants of Hindalew township by tearing apart soldiers and civilians alike with their bare hands. They could not be harmed by normal weapons. They were led by a black sphere with arms and legs who spoke telepathically. The villagers fled and the party set out west in search of weapons.
  
### The Staple Cult
* The party rescued a man with strange blue tattoos from a group of soldiers. They appeared to be ready to staple him with a small metal stable gun. The dead ones all had staples. 
* The man with the blue tattoos went his own way after that night. He claimed to be a member of the Lightspears tribe. 

### Ezraban the Exile
* Ezraban, Keziah's apprentice is catching a ride in Lazluck's brain. He blew his corporeal form to smithereens attempting a reckless spell, trying to escape the wards the 7 Swords of Agor had placed on Keziah's home. He wishes to travel to Nantambu, in hopes of restoring his 

### The World Door
* The World Door is great magical portal that allows extra dimensional travel, Keziah stole and reconstructed the world door. Its original makers, known as the Shori, were capable of great workings, notably flying cities, such as the legendary lost city of Kho.
* There are 3 keys, all of them in the party's possession. 
* There is a great tome of arcane ciphers and secrets that presumably can be used to learn how to operate the door. More research will yield more locations. The only current known ritual will open a portal to the remains of the city of Kho.

### Crowhollow
* The party possesses a strange dead arm, a fusion of necromancy and some unknown workings. The arm can be researched to learn more.

### Bee time
* The party touched statue in a strange garden of an abandoned gnome city and found themselves in the underground lair of some strange gathering of weird bee people.
