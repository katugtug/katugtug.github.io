So what could this boss be besides the obvious Wendigo + computer idea?

What we have shown:  
- Advanced "golem" tech  
- a black sphere with machinery that communicates  
- Dark bronze iron men  
- group of dudes with staples in their necks  

Wendigo is a spirit of hunger, of famine and of savagery. The people of the valley imprisioned the spirit that plagued them in the body of a boy and buried it deep in the earth, sealing it in a place called the nightwell. The nightwell was connected to a unknown crash of a von neumann probe some thousands and thousands of years before. 

The von neumann probe is a self replicating machine. The goal of the probe is to gather enough resources to build more probes and launch them. The probes that it builds can be of any form factor. It is meant to be able to adapt to whatever. The wendigo is a spirit of hunger and cursed cannibalism. It wants people to eat themselves and others. 

The spirit of the wendigo is in the original probe now, after adventurers delved into the nightwell and ended up eating the boy who hosted the spirit. The last of the adventurers made his way deeper into the nightwell caves, and discovered some light and heat there from the probe, sought shelter and refuge.

The ship was unable to do its work due to how it ended up crashed. The probe physically is the size of a football and its core is really the size of a golf ball, but it was housed in an ablative 1 time use structure for rough landings. It just landed weird and couldn't deploy. It is the adventurer which frees it, and it begins to slowly do its work. But then the wendigo comes and things get weird.

So they put wendigo in a boy and chained him up underground,   
boy cursed to hang out underground hosting the malevolent spirit.  
adventurers come, open seal  
fall prey to cannibalism in the caves  
final act, last surviving adventurer eats the boy  
frees the wendigo  
man tries to escape his fate  
flees to probe crash site  
wendigo finds him and eats him  
wendigo possesses the machine  
von neumann wendigo hybrid is born  

It wants to make more probes
but wendigo wants to bring cannibalistic hunger to all

Hows it gonna do these 2 things?

step 1: Recon, it sends out some soldiers to gather intel and resources. It uses up what precious reageants it has to create 5 copies of itself in different form factors. 4 soldiers and an ambassador. However, the wendigos possession was copied as well and this fucks everything up. The wendigo is a solitary creature, distrustful and a bit of an introvert lol and that leads to each of the copies to adopt their own plans rather than follow the grand strategy of their kind. So they all start to endeavor to gather resources in their own way. They are all cursed by the wendigos in their own way, but all still have a basic desire to replicate themselves. In game terms, they need to sacrifice magical items in order to create new probes, aka Clarke's law sort of thing. 
* The ambassador sets out towards Absalom, to collect precious materials and sow lamentation and discord in its own less violent way.  
* One begins to raise an army to delve into the dwarven ruins, to harness the ancient magics found there and the great and vast underdark. This opens the way for more cannibal dwarves, my favorite. This one is obsessed with engineering and doesn't really want to use nerve staples.  
* One seeks only carnage and heads south, raising an army of nerve stapled lunatics and marauders and brings a more traditional threat of armed invasion.  
* One investigates the mossrock woods and potentially clashes with Old Man Blevins. Its a coin toss who overcomes whom and what cost they must pay.  
* And finally, one discovers the world door and understands its power. After gathering intel from refugees, the creature learns of Keziah and the party's contract with Viro. Surmising that the keys have been taken by the party, it puts together an army of nerve stapled hunters and agents and tracks the party. It needs those keys.  

People call it:  
* It Who Chose the Door
* Door hunter 
* Door seeker
* World Seeker
* Huntsworn
* World Traveler
* Farstepper
* The Portal
* Master of Keys
* Key Hunter
* or something, these are all bad.

The primary probe continues its work but none of the probes it dispatched are going to return as they've been cursed with individuality and are on their own missions now. Its continuing to build infrastructure, but it cannot reach space without better materials or a way to free itself of the wendigo so it can make good probes.
