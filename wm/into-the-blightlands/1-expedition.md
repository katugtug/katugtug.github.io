# Into the Blightlands

## Expedition To the Mountains

Malekus is seeking allies in the great north, a group of Menites are rumored to be there, a group of faithful who trace their lineage back to the priest kings.  He sets out across the continent, with lots of money but very few supplies, as he has to travel by ship and rail in disguise. 

The Nyss spot his expedition long before he reaches the mountains. Caught out in the open, Nyss raiders attack his supply train, hoping to force Malekus to retreat or starve.
