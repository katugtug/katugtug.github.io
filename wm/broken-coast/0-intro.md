# The Broken Coast Campaign

## Description

Hidden on an island off the Broken Coast lies an ancient Orgoth tomb, a place long forgotten until a broken coast pirate lost most of his crew trying to loot it a few weeks ago.

His crew told the tale, an ancient tomb of black stone, guarded by spectral warriors. The word spread quickly, by whisper and tale, of this terrible place. Who can say what treasure may lie within!?

The Cult of Cyriss were the first to arrive, led in secret by Locke. Only she knows what she seeks in that deep, dark tomb.

Mortenebra, always keeping tabs on the Cult as best she can, has come to see what the Cult of Cyriss might want with these ruins, to take what Locke may find and make it hers.

The Protectorate vessels appeared carrying Malekus, his mission a clear one: burn this unholy garbage straight to the ground.
