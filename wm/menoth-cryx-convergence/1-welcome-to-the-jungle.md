# The Island Campaign

## Description

Hidden on an island off the Broken Coast lies an ancient Orgoth tomb, a place long forgotten until a broken coast pirate lost most of his crew trying to loot it a few weeks ago.

His crew told the tale, an ancient tomb of black stone, guarded by spectral warriors. The word spread quickly, by whisper and tale, of this terrible place. Who can say what treasure may lie within!?

The Cult of Cyriss were the first to arrive, led in secret by Locke. Only she knows what she seeks in that deep, dark tomb.

Mortenebra, always keeping tabs on the Cult as best she can, has come to see what the Cult of Cyriss might want with these ruins, to take what Locke may find and make it hers.

The Protectorate vessels appeared carrying Malekus, his mission a clear one: burn this unholy garbage straight to the ground.

# Welcome to the Jungle Scenario

1 zone lies in the center of map, a big circle.
4 flags are 6" from the zone, equidistant from deployment. 

Caster kill does not end game, but does make all of your jacks go inert as normal.

The zone represents securing the entrance to the temple.

Score the center zone, win the game.
Score 1 pt per turn if you control a flag. 

# After Action Report

*August 12, 2019* 

Mortenebra and her black metal horrors claim the temple as their own, scattering the resistance and fortifying the entrance. Descending inside, she finds a great cage, a powerful vault meant to keep something inside. Her minions begin the work of dismantling the vault while Mortenebra pores over the runes.

Locke is injured by a whirling blade of a Cryx helljack, her arcantrik power field deflecting the blade just enough to not decapitate her. A follow up blow sends her unconscious. Her vectors, losing their connection with Locke, power down. She is carried to safety by a number of loyal servitors, leaving her vectors for cryx salvagers.

Malekus' flameguard are whittled down by weapons fire from all sides, his jacks reduced to wrecks in melee. Focusing his magic power into his fiery blades, he battles valiantly against Cyriss and Cryx warjacks alike. In the end, he's run out of time, his battle group lies in ruins, Pyrrhus lies dead, and the he must retreat back to his ships.
