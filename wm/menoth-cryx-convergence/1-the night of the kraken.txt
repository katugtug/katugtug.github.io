The Mission:

Hidden on an island off the Broken Coast lies an ancient Orgoth tomb, a place long forgotten until a broken coast pirate lost most of his crew trying to loot it a few weeks ago.

His crew told the tale, an ancient tomb of black stone, guarded by spectral warriors. The word spread quickly, by whisper and tale, of this terrible place. Who can say what treasure may lie within!?

The Cult of Cyriss were the first to arrive, led in secret by Locke. Only she knows what she seeks in that deep, dark tomb.

Mortenebra, always keeping tabs on the Cult as best she can, has come to see what the Cult of Cyriss might want with these ruins, to take what Locke may find and make it hers.

The Protectorate vessels appeared carrying Malekus, his mission a clear one: burn this unholy garbage staight to the ground.


# Welcome to the Jungle

1 zone lies in the center of map, a big circle.
3 flags are 6" from the zone, equidistant from deployment. 

Caster kill does not end game, but does make all of your jacks go inert as normal.

The zone represents securing the entrance to the temple.
