# Convergence of Cyriss vs Protectorate of Menoth: Scenario 1: Surprise Attack on The Temple of the Broken Fist

Northern Bloodstone Marches.

In the dead of night, the Convergence of Cyriss arrives from seemingly nowhere. Living machines of the 9 Harmonics, reason given form. They stride towards the Temple of Broken Fist, seeking the ancient relics buried deep below. What are they after?

Roused by the attack itself, the Flameguard take up their spears. 

## Scenario

2 rectangular zones together to make 1 big 12" x 12" rectangle. This is the holy site.  
In the center of this, place a relic marker.

Put this 18" from defender deployment zone.  

Place walls around the holy site zone. 

Defender deployment zone is 10".

Convergence player is attacker.

Deployment zone is: 7", attacker takes first turn.

Convergence player may place any of his forces in reserve. Convergence player may, at start of their turn, put down a unit from reserve within command of their caster (!!!). This is powerful.

Protectorate player must start with his warcaster and all jacks on the back table edge.

## Goals:
* Convergence player must take the relic, by getting within base to base and using his action.    
* Convergence player must get out of temple zone with the relic by turn 6.  
* Convergence player cannot win by assassination, but controlled jacks will go inert as normal. Protectorate player may win by assassination as normal. 

## Ramifications  
* Convergence good ending: Relic stolen, caster alive.  
* Neutral ending: Relic is secure, but Menoth caster is killed.  
* Protectorate good ending: Relic secure, convergence caster killed.
