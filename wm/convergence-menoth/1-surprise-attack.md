Northern Bloodstone Marches.

In the dead of night, the Convergence of Cyriss arrives from seeming nowhere. Living machines of the 9 Harmonics, reason given form. They stride towards the Temple of Broken Fist, seeking the ancient relics buried deep below.

Roused by the attack itself, the Flameguard take up their spears.
