## Notes on Underwater Stronghold

**Dry docks**: Essentially a large pool that o[ems out in the bottom to the sea.  The tile work here is undecorated, small and close together. Those on the floor are slightly porous, which might be uncomfortable to walk on in bare feet but not unmanageable.  There are some hooks along the wall by the doorway which would have been used for towels.

**Receiving**: A large open area with a very smooth floor and rounded ceiling.  Some basic decorations on the  There is an obvious passage to the intended storage area for goods brought for the general upkeep of the place (in times past)

**Secret door**: Revealed through some pressure plates.  party did not discover that initially but int he time since they have cleared it out there would be no cause to not have found this. It leads to the small forge and beyond that a workshop/storage/armory place.  The design of this area is more 'primitive' and crude as it has been carved into the coral mountainside that the rest of this place sits on. It was built by the historical adventures that once used this place. (There was a part of gelatinous oozes in there, that if someone wants to fashion some humors interactions around, feel free)

**Meeting Hall**: This is a kind of reserve amphitheater in that there are raised rings instead of descending ones, that serve as seating for visitors that would have been entrained here.  The dome overhead depicts a sweeping seascape in fine tile work.  Off this is a passageway to a more private storage area than that of the receiving, where finer things would have been keep to entertain with, such as wines and such.  There is a secret passage between the two storage rooms that much have been used for some reason.  There are signs that this private storage area was converted into some kind of alchemical lab at some point, though most of the chemicals have been removed.

**The observatory:** Constructed out of gifts of glass from gnomes in times past, the thick clear dome gives an open view of the sea that this 'mansion' sits on.  There is the oceanic shelf that this complex rests on, and beyond that the fringes of the raging underwater storm that surrounds *Alta'an T'iss.*

**The Temple:** Ornate in every way, this was crafted by the most skilled historical sea elf clerics, who sought to bring religion to this private abode of their prince.  Every facet of it is dedicated to *Aul’Thalus Son’Thar, the Sungiver, Blessed Warmer of the Seas* though there have been some tapestries thrown up, dating to earlier periods, that are in honor of Eura’fala Faa’Oomis, the Challenger.  In all this place looks like it has been avoided more than any other area.

**Second Observatory** Same as the first

**Special Gate**: This is a typical sea elf feature, one that can be sealed to basically achieve an air lock.  Up to this point, the installation has been more 'basic'.  Beyond this the craftsmanship steps it up by several degrees and the tile work becomes almost offensive with hose much better than it was 'outside'.

**Training**: Large open area with training dummies for sparring and racks for practice weapons.

**Mess Hall**: Circular tables mean to accommodate whole parties in one sitting are the main feature, and typical of sea elf fashion even to this day.  One table however has been 'converted' to have a central fire pit, kind of a hibachi style.  There are no built-in styles of food preservation, keeping with the typical sea elf style of catch-eat-what-you-need.  Minimal food prep areas and utensils.

**Armory**: It has been emptied out, but think more of a hockey team style locker situation, when 'bunkers' for users to store their gear in/on/around.

**Training**: This is more of a relaxation/cool down/recover area.  There is an indoor pool for swimming, but the main feature is the natural hot tub.  Beneath this place must be some kind of mineral vent as the temperate soothing bubble bath awaits.

**Dorm**: This has covered pools.  Essentially what was once an arrangement of bathtub-like pods around the room have been covered over with stone stabs to make them into more common sleeping stations for non-sea elves.  In the center of the room is a gaming table.

**Masterdorm** Think.... circular bed.  Lots and lots of reflective surfaces.  Lots of drapery and pillows.  Yep, that happened here a lot.

**Library**: This is a small, modest attempt at a library.  Most of it in sealed scroll cases.  And nothing that has been updated in several centuries.  There are a couple of books in other languages, such as human and orc, gnome and giant.

**Lounge**: A spacious area with less seating and more bedding for folks to lay out on.  Like the observatories there is a clear dome to the ceiling allowing for a view up to the sea above with the glimmer of the surface in the distance.

**Gallery**: This has a large collection of art, both in paintings but alos in other 'rescued' pieces of various races.  It would appear that the previous owner was a collector of such things.  There is pottery, weaponry, etc.  There are two main large paintings however.  The first shows *Saal'Lore's Raiders*, thought to be the world's first adventuring party.  It looks like it has been specifically placed to cover something up however.  It depicts: **Saal’Lore** (sea elf), **Fae’Dore** (dark elf), **Bissta** (bronze dragonborn), **Elva Steamneedle** (gnome), Kagan (orc war), **Trista Silentstep** (human), **Trip Threefingers** (halfling), **Keldrax** (orc), **Thorn** (wood elf), **Mae’Love Deepsink** (sea elf).  However the most moving piece is surely that of **Cea'Vahla'Sal**, the *Mother of All Sea Elves*, as it is done in the ancient style of 'water painting' where it moves and flows, showing a scene of her in exquisite beauty traveling out through the seas to raising her sword, **Wavebreaker**, to sweeping it through to clear the waters and then repeat.  Truly a priceless piece to sea elves and of tremendous beauty.

**Teleport**: An ancient dias designed for wayfarer magic.  Fortunately Valmax befriended one, and this serves as your connection to the same sort of thing she has in the basement of **Bar Nuun**.

**Vault**: This is locked.  You haven't gotten inside.  On the map that Toots used to get here it promised the *'Eye of Salariuslithium', Mother of Mariliths,* an ancient relic said to allow the user to 'see what they heart desires'.  The lock is a magical one, requiring a verbal command to open.  The script above it in sea elf says you must speak the name of the  'one most loved'.
