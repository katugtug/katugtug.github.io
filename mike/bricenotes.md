We fly into the tower.  
We talk past some kobolds.  
We fight a kobold alchemist and his gunpowder ooze.  
Toots almost gets the party killed due to his ignorance.  
But Toots drinks a potion of nature appreciation and gets turned into a crocodile.  
Toots gives all his money away; all that matters now is how to stop Tiamat.

Practiced of old magic, old magic changes the land in exciting ways.

The way to be remembered is to be forgotten - hag to valmax

Hoss Bolg got up in Sandor's business and found he had an old war injury.
