We walk into kobold room.

Ashiawh has lots of pieces here. 

Lots of books here, things from the wrends.

4th floor, clanking, hissing, steam.

Frozale, god of deliberations and secrets, hard working studious, secret messages, riddles. 

Pantheon is universal.

Up up up my beautiful balloon

Aerylith, a dragon of powerful intent. But apparenlty not a fighter.

She is still in the cage.

We fly into the tower.  

We talk past some kobolds.  

We fight a kobold alchemist and his gunpowder ooze.  

Toots almost gets the party killed due to his ignorance.  

But Toots drinks a potion of nature appreciation and gets turned into a crocodile.  

Toots gives all his money away; all that matters now is how to stop Tiamat.

We started the adventure in the hut of the Ah-killa.

Ah-killa, The Hag, an "advisor", a druid.

Practiced of old magic, old magic changes the land in exciting ways.

**Sandor** is a griffon, he's just a griffon.

The way to be remembered is to be forgotten - hag to valmax

Hoss Bolg got up in Sandor's business and found he had an old war injury.
