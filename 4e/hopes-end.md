# Hope's End

At the edge of the blood soaked lands of the vampire lords lies the town of Hope's End. It is a free city, not defended by any lord or count or part of any nation. It sustains itself by coin and treasure from outsiders. Hope's End citizens all came from somewhere else; few are raising families. There's no graveyard (for reasons). Hope's End has been here for 20 years or so, started by an adventurer's camp, a group who called themselves Blackwatch. Blackwatch is no more, but the town stuck around. 

Why did the Blackwatch come here? The stories of the Emerald mountains and ziggurat mountains beyond them. The blackwatch went into the Emerald Gate and never returned. Soon others came though and Hope's End became a center of outfitters for the adventurers headed north.

## Locations
* Smithy
  * The smith here didn't used to be much of an armor smith, but he's gotten better over the years. He keeps a number of weapons of all sorts in stock, but mostly sharpens weapons, repairs armor while his apprentices shoe horses and the like. He doesn't have time to craft anything really involved, but could make time if the pay is right and he has the right tools.
* Outfitters 
  * Sells rations, lanterns, torches, pitons, climbing gear, etc. 
* Tavern / Inn - The Cracked Flagon run by Pippal
* Stable
  * You can buy draft animals here, mules and horses. Not much plow pulling going on up here, so there's lots of travelling horses here, a few fast ones, but lots that can carry a load.
* Wagoneer and Cooper

# About the Lands to the North

* Hope's End lies on the edge of undead influence. Going further north becomes increasingly dangerous.
* There are several distinct peoples in the north of the mountain, all of them now under the sway of vampire lords. 
* Folklore holds that the vampires were defeated by the gods in ancient times.
* Vampires generally rule the cities (much of them), but free peoples exist in the jungles, but increasingly less so, they are being hunted for blood and / or sport.
* Besides vampires, other groups make ploys for power.
* The dead sometimes rise on their own in these lands.
* Much of the wealth of the former rulers here is consolidated into vampire holds.

# Bad Guy Groups
* The Priest: One of the vampire lords is driven mad with divinity, believing herself to be an instrument of the Sun In The Sky, for the gods are not happy with their creation and must start again, anew. She is a butcher. Her thralls terrorize the jungles of their homelands.
* Larva Mage cult
* Necromancer group
* Savage orcs 
* Cult of Zehir, the snake god. 

# Coyopa Forest
* Metaplot tie in: The necromancer flees from the vampires in the north. The PCs may take him as an ally if they can. He is a native of the northern Chiche` peoples.
* Ruins dot these woods, these used to be dwarven hunting grounds when they ruled the emerald mountains.
* Tales of a dragon in these woods, a great green beast.
  * That dragon is now dead, killed by some adventurers, but the necromancer has reanimated it and its a strong ally, though a shade of its former self. Who killed it originally? It's horde has been removed, but a dangerous cave remains that the necromancer stays in currently with his living entourage.
  * There is a young green dragon here, abandoned after it's mother died.
* Goblins hunt around in this forest.
* Savage orcs are also found here.
* The necromancer and his people have fled to here. 
* They compete with dryads and goblins for control of the forest. 
* Dwarven ruins are open to all sorts of malevolent creatures to take up residence, but also stocked with dwarven-centric treasure.


# History of the Emerald Mountains
* DC 15: Dwarven hegemony ended here 500 years ago, when the last of the fortresses fell in the Emerald Mountains. It had been in decline for 300 years before that, slowly losing territory above and below. No one knows what dwarves survive in the Emerald Mountains today. 
* DC 20: Dwarves of the Emerald Mountains were ostracized from other dwarven kingdoms for their views on magic and their relations with other races. While Emerald Dwarves regarded their cousins normally, they took as slaves and terrorized most other races if given the opportunity.

#Karain
The other town

* Led by a group of bandits and highwaymen, used to be a gang called of a man named Thrain.
* Now the band of a vampire thrall, a chiche human.
* Church blacked out, lots of slaves in town being shipped north. Many of these are goblins and some orcs and half orcs, people that live around here.
