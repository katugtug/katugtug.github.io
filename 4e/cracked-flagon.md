Pippal Burrow, overweight male halfing. Burn scars on arms and hands. Friendly.

Victor, muscle bound half elf cook. Beer belly. Sailor tattoos. Middle aged.

# The Inn

The inn is a single story timber and brick building, with a white tile roof. Accomodations consist of several large common rooms with beds and straw mattresses and wooden cots near the hearth. Foot lockers are provided, but not locks. 

The hearth room has a number of tables and benches for eating and drinking. There's a square bar where Pippal serves drinks.

There's an open air kitchen out back where Victor makes food and a cellar with a lock that has the food and liquor stores.
