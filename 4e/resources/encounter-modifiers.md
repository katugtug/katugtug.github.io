# Assumptions

1. **The Timer** - All encounters should resolve themselves within 3-6 rounds, unless this is meant to be an endurance challenge or a climax of some kind. Generally, after 6 rounds or less, the GM should evaluate the status of the battlefield and make some resolutions about how the story moves forward. Either the enemies flee and are cut down, or they succeed at something that is going to make the PCs lives harder. In any case, don't allow combats to drag on beyond the fun zone and always try to have encounters end with treasure, story reward, or some other interesting development (new information for example).

2. **Terrain** Every encounter should have some terrain that makes it interesting, not just a flat arena on every map. Difficult terrain and impassible terrain sprinkled around is a good start. Things like chasms, fires, forests, fog, magical darkness, these are all good terrain options. Have enemies use items which make terrain, like smoke and fog.

3. **Treasure rooms (aka the Zelda rule)**  Every dungeon should have an encounter that is very challenging and offers optional but exceptional rewards. It should generally be avoidable and not follow the adventurers to their deaths if it wins the fight. Perhaps a hall of exceptionally difficult traps that reset and change? Or a iron golem! Very difficult unless the party is prepared. Allow the adventurers to come back later if they need to level up first, but allow them a glimpse of the fantastic treasures on the other side.

# Terrain Ideas

## Cavern / Dungeon
1. **Poisonous mushrooms** The air around these shrooms is filled with spores. They make a fortitude attack against you which can poison you.

## City
1. **Oil Barrel** These are barrels filled with lamp oil and can cause big, spreading fires if ignited. They can also grease a patch of land.
   
## Forest
1. **Hunting Snares** Counter weighted hunting snare like in the movies, deploys a big net that catches the victim (or the whole party).

# Interesting Encounter Modifiers

1. **Endless Hordes** Enemies continue to come assault the party, no matter how many you kill. You must close them off, complete a ritual, or escape in order to win this fight.

2. **Hold the Gate** Opponents attempt to scale a wall or breach a gate, where the narrow hall gives the party a big advantage. Or the opposite, the PCs must attack a gate that is held by a small group of enemies.

3. **Convince the gatekeeper** A gatekeeper holds the means of escape and he is a third party. The party is being attacked by a 2nd party and convincing, intimidating or otherwise persuading the gatekeeper may be the means of escape / success.

4. **Hidden assailants** While the party is unaware such as camping, a group of sneaky individuals attempt to eliminate the party members one at a time.

5. **Puzzle fight** An puzzle encounter involving a secret message and floor tiles while at the same time fighting an encounter.

6. **Light the Beacon** A small group of bad guys flee the party and must make their way through the woods or dungeon to their reinforcements. Skill challenge plays a part in chasing these guys down before its too late.

7. **Elevation** - There's a raised area on the battlefield, maybe with some ladders for climbing. There's the ability to knock people off with bull rush for falling damage.

8. **2 planes** There's a hole in the ground or a ladder that connects 2 different planes with no line of sight between them. A street fight combines with a sewer fight below, for example.

9.  **Chasm** Combat where a Athletics leap will get you access to an advantageous position or access to ranged attackers.   

10. **Narrow ledge** A narrow ledge must be balanced across in order to gain an advantage in the combat.

11. **Smoke or fog.** Large patches of smoke or fog obscure the battlefield. They can be light or heavy, either granting concealment or invisibilty.

12. **Creeping fire** A fire starts small at the beginning of the encounter, but grows quickly. Explosive barrels for extra fun.

13. **Web Trab** A trap sets off a giant drop of spider web, while giant spider begin to descend from the ceiling for a meal.

1. **The Sacrifice must be completed** - The enemies have captured a unwilling sacrifice and plan to cut its throat for a dark god. The players enter the chamber. Can they stop it before its too late? Either its enough that the hostage dies, but its possible that the sacrifice is accepted by some foul diety and it sends an ally to help the bad guys.
   
2. **Melting Treasure** The party must fill their pockets quickly as the temple collapses around them. What do they take? Will they take too much to be able to escape ?

16. **Illumination** - One part or all parts of the encounter area either have dim light or darkness. Provide a method, with actions, to add illumination.

17. **Chandelier / Scaffolding** - The fight takes places with a few pieces of heavy equipment dangling over the battlefield.

18. **Patrol** - 2 guards patrol a set of rooms on a set pattern.
    
19. **Guards** - 2 guards hold a door, halt who goes there?  

20. **Scouts** - a small group ranges out looking for danger and finds the group.
