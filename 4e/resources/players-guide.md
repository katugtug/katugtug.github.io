# Races

* *Dragonborn* - Red dragonborn natives have been run out of their homeland and most seek to reclaim it. They also probably caused it.
* *Dwarf* (Traditional dwarves closer to the surface than they want after losing their ancestral home.)
* *Eladrin* (elves who still call the Feywild home aka High Elves)
* *Elf* (Elves who call the terrestrial dimension home, aka wood elves. They are hated and feared by their neighbors but rarely emerge from their woods.)
* *Gnome* (Natives of the Feywild as well, beings born of magical dimension)
* *Half-elf* (There are half-elven prominent city states which are traders and sailors around a vast inner sea. Similar to half orcs, half elves carry elven blood potentially from centuries ago, but they maintain a separate cultural group)
* *Half-orc* (Noble half orc houses fight a brutal war against their pure kin for autonomy in the western continent.)
* *Humans* - 4 different cultural groups of Humans, a theocratic bent, an agrarian bent and a nomadic bent and a warrior bent. Some are native to the continent, others migrated here bringing foreign customs.
* *Tieflings* - The union of infernal and man is often seen amongst the Steppe lords of the west, who openly negotiate with devils.
* *Deva* - Long ago, a god fell in the desert and the devas of the desert kingdoms are a modern reminder, often rising to positions of power along the walled city states of the northern desert.
* *Goliaths* - Goliaths toil as slaves to their orc conquerors, while only a few free goliaths still live in their native mountains.
* *Shifters* - Bestial humanoids call the tropical jungles of the northeast home.
* *Githzerai* - Refuges from the Astral Sea, they meditate high in their mountain strongholds while the east falls to the scourge around them.
* *Shardmind* - When the Far Gate was sundered and unfettered the Astral Sea, these beings of pure psionic force surged into being.
* *Wilden* - Plant people, embodiments of nature have risen up from seeming no where to fight against the scourge.

# Classes

**A note on Builds** So each class entry has a "suggested build", these are just suggestions, and their names are included below the class names below.
