title: Lucan
---

**Lucan** was born to a Ralnor, a devote warrior, and Merissa, an even more devoted priestess.  Believers in the Eladrin Traditions, they had four kids - one for each season.  His eldest sister, **Milena**, became a templar.  His older brother, **Caladrel**, was a tralented jeweler and craftsman.  **Lucan**, the fall child, took to the teachings of church and was a steadfast alter boy.  His youngest sister, **Shael**, was a troubled soul but a brilliant artist.

Lucan's father fought against the orcs, and when he returned  from one terrible instance from them, he was a changed elf.  No longer a stern disciplinarian,  he was reserved, distant and both physically and emotionally scarred.  The change to the family dynamics put pressure on all of the children to  better perform, but Lucan felt it most of all.  Rather that rising to the challenge like his siblings, he ran.  His doubts about the inactivity of his teachings combined with what he saw what was done to his father by actions and this spurred him into leaving it all behind.  Just thorty years old, he ran to the half-elf lands to lose himself and seek a greater purpose.

There instead he found something else.  Something more than companionship.  **Roldan Stavenge** was a strong, proud man, one of bold action and regular conquest.   Lucan was never certain what **Roldan** saw in him, but together the two planned to venture to other lands.  For this Roldan took on a job with a dangerous expedition to the north as the pay that was promised was too great to turn down.  **Roldan** never returned.
Distraught, Lucan sought to go after **Roldan**.  Yet before he could run off to the jungles, he was stopped by **Roldan**'s friend and trainer, the gnome **Iviss Blimth**.  She was a stout woman, one short on stature but who ad learned to carry a big stick.  She saw how hurt Lucan was and sought to help the Eladrin shape it, teaching him how to fight (and especially with heavier, larger weapons than oneself) but instead of gaining focus, Lucan lost it.  He gave in to the rush of combat, taking to back alley street fights.  He wasn't great at it, but he didn't care.  He didn't care about much of anything.

Which is when an envoy from the Eladrin to the half-elf city found him, rescued him and brought him home.  It was the priest **Arlen** that saw something in Lucan, taking the now sixty plus year old under his wing.  Instead of returning Lucan to the cloth as a priest, **Arlen** saw the potential to make use of what Lucan had learned, shaping him instead into an avenger.

Comfortable around other races, Lucan continues to be assigned tasks that put him in the service of non-Eladrin, perhaps as a test of faith, to see if he will roam too far from home ever again.

## Vamp story
Near every race has their own version of the story; the origin of vampires. For the Eladrin, it traces back to Vladros the Betrayer, though before that he was know as the Warden of winter.  When their homeland would be recalled to the Feywild, he was the protector chosen to watch over the site so that when it returned, it would be safe.  Only when the homeland returned after one long winter season of which Vladros was to stand watch, the Eladrin returned to find the site void of life.  Bloodless bodies littered the ground, with Vladros nowhere to be found.  It was later learned that he had attempted to court death, to trick the god of death with his wiles, but she was to have known of it and so when Vladros was found out, he was cursed.  No longer living nor allowed to die, he had become something else.  Upon attempting to return to his people he encountered the great hunger, and feasted, but then retreated in shame before the prime Eladrin return.  Thus, he remains out there, a figure of great shame and pity; a reminder of the dangers of vanity.
