# Dwarven Halls

## Overview
The city of Silver Point was once a prosperous surface town of the Emerald Clans, a place where the surface world could freely interface with the Dwarves below, trading in the many goods of the dwarven clans. That time is long past, the Dwarves below have fallen victim to a ravenous curse, beasts stalk their former halls, looters from the vampire kingdoms dig through the ruins for a certain treasure and the source of the curse, dwarven refugees pass generations in the high mountains searching for a cure for their people's suffering, and finally, a force below, seeing Moradin's Will (aka the Green Gate) has been breached, seeks escape from its prison. 

The players arrive after Moradin's Will has been sundered by the dark magics of the vampire wizard Tli Xahkec. Xahkec makes his way into the halls now, seeking the Curse of Mammon for his master.

## Rumors and Clues

### Dowles and Tli Xahcec  
1. Dowles ain't been acting right. He was okay a few weeks ago, but after we heard Doru had bit it, Dowles ain't hisself.
2. The Vampire guy, never seen his face, doesn't come out during the day, he's got an iron wagon he stays in. 
3. Vampire guy is a powerful wizard, saw him pull a beast's skeleton out of its mouth, damnest thing I've ever seen.
4. There's only about 30 of Dowles men left, but they are some of his best. 
5. We could hear scratching on the other side of the wall. When the gate came out, a tide of rats came out. Bones everywhere in there.
6. Tli Xahkec has a map that he'd pieced together from bits of things we found in Silver Point. It never really seemed like he'd gotten enough info.


### The Beasts

### The Nature of the Curse and the Ancient Evil

### The Refugees
7. There's a few dwarves around in the mountains, there's a path from Silver Point into the high mountains.
8. We went up there once, looking for some elk or mountain goats, something to eat. We found a bear, lost 2 men bringing it down inside its cave. As we were hauling it out, a bird the size of a tower swooped down, pecked Borios in two and took off with the bear. Having lost 3 men, we had to come back home empty handed.
9. The dwarves there are cagey, we found lots of traps, lost a few men to falling rocks. 
10. Never was able to find where them dwarves make camp, but Dowles forbid any more venturing in the mountains, after we'd lost 5 to traps and animals.


### The Dwarves and their Tresure

## The approach

### Possible encounter: The Wagon, attacked by beasts
On the way to the Emerald mountains, you'll find the remains of one of the wagons headed towards Karain. It's goods are mostly intact, lots of treasure from the Dwarven Halls. However, its been scattered, evidence of blood can be found and the crew is no where to be found. This attack occured weeks ago. Savage attackers killed everyone, hauled off the bodies and scavenged only weapons from the remains, leaving the rest in the mud.

### Possible encounter: One of Dowles Men
Morale isn't high with Dowles, especially now that new of Doru's demise has spread through the ranks, the boot on their necks may just be light enough for some of Dowles men to consider running. 

One such individual scooped up all he could carry quietly and ran off in the night. He had a partner, but that partner caught a goblin arrow passing through Ironback and within a few hours was too weak to continue. He is just trying to make his way to Hope's End safely. He has info on Dowles and the wizard if the PCs will spare him some supplies. He knows 2 things from the rumors table.
  

Nestled in the Emerald Mountain, the Green Gate is a primary southern entrance into the Dwarven Halls of the Emerald Kings. A fortress stands at the entrance to the valley (**Steelback Fortress**), but it has long fallen into ruin and now is inhabited primarily by goblinoids, especially the keep at its center and the halls beneath. It can be explored for clues about the fate of the dwarves and some treasure they may of left behind. Especially of interest are verdigris remains of a great number of bronze automatons.

Passing the fortress and making your way up the valley, it's well built and drained surfaces are still mostly intact. The broad road continues all the way to the city of **Green Gate**. There is evidence of fresh wagon tracks here, as much of the Green Gate City has been looted

## 1. Ironback Fortress
Standing guard over the valley that leads into Silver Point, the Ironback fortress was a dwarven military fort, but has fallen into ruin. In the warmth of the lower altitude, brush and vines have claimed much of the fortress, slowly pulling apart the stones year over year. Despite this, many of the fortress walls still stand. There are two primary locations in this fortress. The gatehouses which stands in the valley floor and the fortress itself, built into the cliffside some 50 feet above the valley floor. The fortress offers a birds eye view of the both sides of the gatehouse, allowing defenders to rain down missiles on the attackers. In order to get further into the valley, would be attackers need to scale or batter through both walls, while defenders in the fortress above attack them. There are 2 doorways for infantry to ascend the fortress, and a switchback for hauling heavier equipment and supplies into the fortress above. 

Two towers flank the switchback entrance, while the tight infantry corridors and staircases grant special advantage to short defenders. The fortress itself is carved into the stone, its halls providing living quarters for a garrison of 300 dwarves. A great well is sunk through hundreds of feet of stone to access ground water. Grub and mushroom farms provide siege rations for the stations dwarves as well as great stores.

The dwarves of Ironback Fortress perished soon after the curse took hold, brother against brother, their impressive defenses were little defense against Mammon's Curse.

Formerly, goblin's held the Ironback fortress, pelting those who passed below with poison arrows. Grizzer the Greatest, a goblin of small intellect but great savagery and charimsa. Hes had a number of pets, weird creatures like cloakers. However, Tli Xahcec unseated him and raised many of his followers as undead. The rest have scattered.

Tli has left a 'garrison' here, led by a wight. The goblin skeletons rain down arrows on passersby.

### Encounters in Ironback Fortress

level 5: 
1x Blazing Skeleton 5 Artillery 200
1x Boneshard Skeleton 5 Brute 200
4x skeletons with bows 3 4x 150

7. **Elevation** - There's a raised area on the battlefield, maybe with some ladders for climbing. There's the ability to knock people off with bull rush for falling damage.
 
Counter: 6 turns
Objective: Reach the top of the switchback in 6 rounds.
Success: You scatter the skeletons at the top of the balcony.
Failure: Skeletons raise the alarm; the wight knows of the attack and will be prepared.

**The entrance to the fortress: 1 tower has fallen, a great gate lies sundered**
1 tower remains.

1x zombie hulk 350 
2x gravehounds 300
10x zombie rotter minions 350

Each turn a skeleton is added to the fight.
Counter: in 4 turns, the wight arrives with his entourage, but afterwards no monsters appear.
Objective: defeat the zombie hulk in time so you dont have to face everyone.

The hulk throws a great barrel, it smashes on the ground and a great fire begins to rage on the top switchback platform, whipped by the winds and consuming the brush.
When you enter fire, take ongoing 5. If you end your turn in fire, take another ongoing 5.

12. **Creeping fire** A fire starts small at the beginning of the encounter, but grows quickly. Explosive barrels for extra fun.

The vampire thrall arrives. Draped in a great golden cloak, he appears to be a commander or officer of the Sun Knights, the foot phalanx soldiers. He is flanked by 4 other lesser wights, also in formation with dirty gilded armor.

The Sun Knight Commander is a Hobgoblin Commander (with +1 damage and +2 everything (level 7) else). The other thralls are Hobgoblin soldiers with +1 damage and +2 to everything (level 5)

The fire and the edge of the switchback can be used to fight these guys. Separating their phalanx makes them mad. Standing in the light gives them ongoing 5 dmaage.

They won't come out in the dark, but will fire arrows from the darkness at the party.


Fortress loot:
* Dwarven trade ledger
* destroyed automatons
* 3 parcels of treasure.
