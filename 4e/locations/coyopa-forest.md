# Coyopa Forest
* Metaplot tie in: The necromancer flees from the vampires in the north. The PCs may take him as an ally if they can. He is a native of the northern Chiche` peoples.
* Ruins dot these woods, these used to be dwarven hunting grounds when they ruled the emerald mountains.
* Tales of a dragon in these woods, a great green beast.
  * That dragon is now dead, killed by some adventurers, but the necromancer has reanimated it and its a strong ally, though a shade of its former self. Who killed it originally? It's horde has been removed, but a dangerous cave remains that the necromancer stays in currently with his living entourage.
  * There is a young green dragon here, abandoned after it's mother died.
* Goblins hunt around in this forest.
* Savage orcs are also found here.
* The necromancer and his people have fled to here. 
* They compete with dryads and goblins for control of the forest. 
* Dwarven ruins are open to all sorts of malevolent creatures to take up residence, but also stocked with dwarven-centric treasure.

## Individual Encounters in Coyopa Forest
1. Dwarven Keep (hunting lodge)
   The civilization of the emerald mountains dwarves was eventually wiped out by a plague that emerged from the Nine Hells, from Mammom, devil of greed. The dwarves ate each other, than they ate themselves. This could be related to the vampires, b

   1. The Outer wall
      1. As the party approaches the outer wall of the keep, savage orcs begin to gather. (if they see the party)
      2. They are hungry and gaunt (-2 levels)
      3. The party can fight them, but its better to get the door working (simple athletics) to use the walls against the orcs. Harder to shove it closed. Easier to use gate controls above the gate with thievery.
      4. The party can also make use of the deep trench and rusting equipment (rough terrain).
      5. The party can close the trench as well.
      6. The number of orcs will grow and they'll attack if the PCs havent
   2. The Fallen Lodge
      1. A stone building dominates the center of the fort, but its a recreational building. Made of local stone, but with large windows and openings. The heavy stone pillars that hold it up haven't broken yet. The inside is surrounded by taxidermied animals now falling apart, hanging from the inside of the building. 
      2. Antique weapons are along the walls. A spot where a warhammer lay is bare.
      3. There is some time to look around before the phantom warriors attack. They howl and come in, some of them missing pieces, all of them bleeding spectral blood from their mouths. Most have been killed with a hammer.
   3. The Hall Below  
      1. Private quarters are here, but they are stripped of wealth. 
      2. Ancient automations circle around a trigger that has long since been pressed. These are the private quarters of an individual, separate from the small rooms above. This is the home of whoever built this place.
      3. The hall leads to a trigger, btu the trigger lever has been pulled. A giant stone door, massive and imposing, has been lowered.
      4. Outside the treasure room, there was a battle. Many dead dwarves lie around dead, their bodies rotten to bones. These all seem to have their belongings. A tunic, edged in blood red thread and a thickly strung bow. The automations, carved from clay and forged with iron weapons guard them.
   4. The Treasure Room
      1. Guarded by a massive stone door that won't budge under conventional means. Inside, the builder of this place, now dead, buried with his gold.
2. The Pit
   1. Follow your nose (Skill Challenge)    
      1. Perception - Follow smell
      2. Nature - look for tracks
   2. Closer to the Pit (goblins live here now and lay traps)
   3. The Ring of the Pit ( a fight on 2 planes, where goblins try to trap people inside the pit entrance and rain arrows upon them.)
   4. The Pit
      1. A deep pit where much treasure has fallen, but guarded by a carrion crawler
      2. Another place where a hobgoblin and his goblin friends live.
3. Necromancer Camp
   1. Undead vs Goblins observed battle.
   2. Undead skirmishers try to draw the party away. 
   3. Finding the Camp (simple challange, failure, you find the pit.)
   4. Meet the Necromancer (Skill Challenge, failure results in expulsion or a fight.)

# The Pit
* Very stinky former home to a green dragon.
* Carvings, eladrin style, show a guarded orb
* Vampire agents came in a murdered the dragon, stole the orb. 
* Thousands of thralls and zombies died in the attack on the dragon, their brutalized corpses are what stinks.
* In the fighting, the cave collapsed, scattering much of the dragons horde into a deep pit. 
* Carrion crawlers and ottyghs guard the horde now.
* Goblins led by a brutal hobgoblin live here now, trying to get used to the stink. They cant get to the treasure, but many have died trying.
