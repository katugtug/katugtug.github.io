# Hope's End

At the edge of the blood soaked lands of the vampire lords lies the town of Hope's End. It is a free city, not defended by any lord or count or part of any nation. It sustains itself by coin and treasure from outsiders. Hope's End citizens all came from somewhere else; few are raising families. There's no graveyard (for reasons). Hope's End has been here for 20 years or so, started by an adventurer's camp, a group who called themselves Blackwatch. Blackwatch is no more, but the town stuck around. 

Why did the Blackwatch come here? The stories of the Emerald mountains and ziggurat mountains beyond them. The blackwatch went into the Emerald Gate and never returned. Soon others came though and Hope's End became a center of outfitters for the adventurers headed north.

## Locations
* Smithy
  * The smith here didn't used to be much of an armor smith, but he's gotten better over the years. He keeps a number of weapons of all sorts in stock, but mostly sharpens weapons, repairs armor while his apprentices shoe horses and the like. He doesn't have time to craft anything really involved, but could make time if the pay is right and he has the right tools.
* Outfitters 
  * Sells rations, lanterns, torches, pitons, climbing gear, etc. 
* Tavern / Inn - The Cracked Flagon run by Pippal
* Stable
  * You can buy draft animals here, mules and horses. Not much plow pulling going on up here, so there's lots of travelling horses here, a few fast ones, but lots that can carry a load.
* Wagoneer and Cooper

# About the Lands to the North

* Hope's End lies on the edge of undead influence. Going further north becomes increasingly dangerous.
* There are several distinct peoples in the north of the mountain, all of them now under the sway of vampire lords. 
* Folklore holds that the vampires were defeated by the gods in ancient times.
* Vampires generally rule the cities (much of them), but free peoples exist in the jungles, but increasingly less so, they are being hunted for blood and / or sport.
* Besides vampires, other groups make ploys for power.
* The dead sometimes rise on their own in these lands.
* Much of the wealth of the former rulers here is consolidated into vampire holds.
