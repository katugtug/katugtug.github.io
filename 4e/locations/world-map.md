## The Red Night

The year 380 was marked by the Red Night, a point where the Far Gate was sundered and the Far Realm aka the Astral Sea, began to bleed into our world. It was marked by a loud telepathic echo that all living creatures heard as a mighty rumble for several minutes. Afterwards, the night sky turned crimson for some time. 

>    "And as I lay down to rest that night, there came a sudden jolt to the senses, a maddening terrible roar in my mind. I've never felt anything like it since. In distress, I stumbled from my bed only to find my housemaid similarly distraught. As soon as it had come on, it was over in the space of a minute or two, leaving an echo in our minds and an terrible trepidation that the sensation might reoccur. All of this was put aside of course upon reaching the window of my bedchamber. For there, the night sky was changed.  It's normal black dispelled by a brilliant crimson. It bathed the city in the ominous hue for around an hour, dissipating completely before dawn."

Since this time, psionic powers began to manifest.

# Note on Politics (Especially in the human agrarian states)

These areas are not nations per se, they are cultural groups that bleed into each other and overlap. The typical organization is of a lord and his house controlling a hundred to a thousand square miles. Many of these houses form their own alliances and ink their own treaties and trade deals. 

Many of the jockeying and bickering neighbors will ally vs outside forces, but many the scheming lord has responded too slowly to an attack in order to allow his rival's lands to be pillaged a bit longer, or used the absense of his rival's armies to move in and consolidate power in the homeland.

Those who have trade centers in their cities are fortunate to collect a lot of taxes, but find their bottom line constantly assailed by smugglers and their officials constantly overcome by bribes.

# The East

Play in the east if you want to wage an existential war campaign against an undeniably bad enemy.

## Arkosian Mountains

* Former home of the Red Dragonborn and the last remnants of the Arkosian empire. The rise of the Scourge has pushed them west.   
  * City: Skyhall

* The scourge is a merging of the Shadowfell, a dimensional rift emanating from the Crimson Court (political seat of power) in Skyhall. A wizard named **Daeth of  Xiilius**, after much research, seeking to locate the ancient arms of the Arkosian Emperors, opened a rift into the Plane of Shadows. In that moment, a powerful being slipped through. That's when the trouble started. Implacable, he remains there and the rift widens. More native creatures come through, seemingly sustained by the rift and the being. It's unclear what it wants, but the lands are dangerous to all life and its influence is spreading. 

* A monastery of high in the mountains, peopled by refuges from the astral sea, mainly Githzerai are under siege. They fight stalwartly, but their fate is inevitable. 

## Central mountains (the Grundi Mountains, Emerald Mountains) 

### Dwarves
* Dwarves of the central mountains (the Grundi Mountains, Emerald Mountains) have lived here for centuries and dug deep and seek to fight the Scourge but are unprepared to do so.   
* Expert craftsmen and fine warriors, their ancient runes protect their halls.  
* They are fighting a war in their lower holds against a vicious rat race they call the skaven. Disease whittles their ranks and they've lost many.
* Preoccupied with the rat wars, they have few resources to devote to the scourge at their door.

### Redannian Knights
* The remnants of the Redannian Kingdom are a cultural group, now divided by civil war for centuries and divided into fiefdoms vying for power. They have lived here for a long time, originally migrating from the central continent a thousand years ago and bringing their mighty steeds with them.
* Redannian humans are marked by their dark skin, common in the central continent.  
* Redannians are cavalry masters, heavy horse without equal. They cover their horses in impenetrable scale mail and are masters of the lance and spear.

### Wilden Allies
* In northern Redannian territories, Wilden, seemingly living intelligent humanoid plant people have appeared in battles with the scourge. Their enigmatic help is welcomed.
* It is speculated by some that these Wilden are like an immune system of the natural world, responding to the threat of the Scourge.

### Dragonborn allies
* Huge influxes of dragonborn, mostly south of the Emerald Mountains, has caused big resource issues for the southern Redannian kingdoms, with Lords unwilling to part with their resources in anticipation of the coming wars. A few of the lords have seen an opportunity to use the dragonborn as shock troops / expendable forces and tolerate them as such, but the Dragonborn have in general received little succor here. Most stay here, longing to return home, others venture further inland in search of a new life.

### Wood Elves
* A dark wood exists here, untouched by man, unsullied by civilization. It's a hundred miles wide, but to travel from end to end is impossible, for its winding ways stretch much further. 
* Exiles from the Feywild, wood elves now call the terrestrial plane their home. 
* They are led by a powerful queen who firmly believes in returning the world to a natural state and that people are best un-ruled and un-politicized. Her magic is incredibly potent, but convincing her to use it is tough. 
* She is not friendly to non-elves. She is not really friendly in general, though does want what is best for the world (Which is generally not saving dwarves and men from their fate)
* The elves are openly hostile (albeit defensively) to their neighbors and generally answer all calls for help with silence or flights of arrows. They have an ancient enmity with the dwarves.
* Every elf is a kingdom undo hisself the saying goes. Elves are not bound to any king or queen and are free to wander and pursue their arts in any way they see fit. Elf on elf conflict is rare.

# Central Continent

## The Desert Princedoms
* Dominated by desert sands, most civilization in this area clings to a central river for fresh water. 
* All along this river are scores of walled city states, ruled by kings.  
* Long ago, the story goes, a god fell from the sky in this area. That god was a great conqueror. He/she was known as **Shaddia**, a warrior god able to charm the hearts of women and men with a gaze and crumble city walls with a word. **Shaddia** fathered and gave birth to many children in the age of myth before eventually moving on to where ever.
* Of that bloodline, many are rulers today, Devas, those with holy god blood running in their veins, but mortal like most things. Devas form a majority of the warrior kings who dominate the desert princedoms.
* War is common here as cities are fought over and position towards the mouth of the river is vied for. (the water, when it finally reaches the ocean, is filthy)

## The Desert
* In the age of myth, the desert was a bountiful coastal land, crisscrossed by many rivers (now dry). As such, it is filled with hundreds or thousands of ruins, some more ancient than others. 
* Great ziggurats now half or totally covered in sand, with whatever hidden treasure inside. No one knows much of these civilizations for the ruins are difficult to explore and extremely dangerous.
* Stories of hidden oasis' where bandits form great pirate cities are common.
* Nomadic tribes cross the desert in search of food.

## Dwarven Kingdoms (Shardminds)

* The central dwarven kingdom is the largest in the world, its capital city known as **Greatforge**, is a wonder of dwarven engineering. However, the dwarves long for another home, now lost to dark elves, where they came from originally. It's been 3,000 years since the last dwarf set foot in **Deephearth**, but the dwarven memory is long and every dwarf dreams still of reclaiming that great hall below.

* Dwarves are ruled by one great king and one ruling clan, the Clan of Grudak, and King Krain IV. Krain of Grudak is a vain ruler, now eaten up by grief and hatred. He spends great amounts of time alone and his council of diplomats and councilors attend to the kingdom. He is without heir and there are rumblings of the Great Council being called again to elect a new king, an event hasn't been seen since Krain I.

* In the year 380 the Shardminds awoke. They are a crystalline people of keen intellect, imbued with natural psionic power from the sundering of the Far Gate and the opening of the Astral Sea (see a astrologer). They are entirely alien beings with a close link to the astral sea. They emerged from dwarven gem holds after the Red Night.
