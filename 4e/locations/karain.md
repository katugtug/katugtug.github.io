## Karain
Once a prosperous trading community near the dwarven settlement of the Green Gate, Karain is basically no more. The town was ruled by a criminal and his cutthroats Thrain, before Thrain was killed by the very odd Duro. Duro has instituted some new policies, mainly slavery, and devoted all of the towns efforts towards moving goods from the wreckage of the Green Gate out of the town. 

The buildings of the town have fallen into disrepair as most of the inhabitants have left.

### Outskirts
* Slave pens can be seen, big fences with lots of hungry people inside and lots of guards on the perimeter.
  * Skill challenge to sneak by the guards and gain audience with a slave.

### Downtown
* The Temple of Moradin now blacked out with heavy sheets covering the few windows of the massive stone building.
  * Big chimney could provide entrance.
* The other temple, that of Pelor, has been destroyed. 
  * Beneath the charred rubble, there is a small catacombs. Dungeoneering or perception to spot, getting in is harder.
* The Salty Grog, There's an tavern here still, its basically empty but can serve up rumors.
  * Rumors Duro, tell you about Thrain and Dowles, the plan, the beasts.


### Bridgeside
* Slaves marched out onto road. 
* Big wagons here and lots of draft animals, setting out over the bridge.

### Duro
Duro was a proud warrior before his tribe was defeated by the Priest's followers. As the most noble and powerful warrior among them, he was turned into a lieutenant of the Priest. Driven by mind control and hunger, he seeks to please his new master.

Duro sleeps in the temple of Moradin by day, guarded by his most elite and trusted guards. (skeletons) Duro is a sort of mixture of a wight and a vampire lord. He is still destroyed by sunlight, but has the ability to reanimate the dead as zombies and to drink blood to regain HP. Otherwise is the lvl 5 wight skirmisher. He carries an obsidian axe, rather than claws.

The undead that Duro can create are not smart. They have very little animus but can be made to stand in one place and attack things that near them.

### Duros Dilemnia
**Duro** has been sent here by **the Priest** to get the written words of the Dwarves, speciallically those bearing the **mark of mammon**, to the north. He has killed **Thrain** and then was forced to kill or imprision another quarter of them while another quarter fled. So he now has a disgruntled gang of 'loyal' cutthroats, but they actually follow one of **Thrain's** Lieutenants, **Dowles**. **Dowles** and his men are in the Green Gate, sifting through wreckage for sign of the **Mark of Mammon**, which has been described to them. They aren't finding much about **Mammon**, but are discovering a great amount of dead dwarves and their treasure. This makes **Dowles** happy and his men happy. Get get to keep half of it. Its a fine line though, they have narrowly avoided disaster by beastmen, undead and other things in the dwarven halls.

While all of his loyal followers are mining the dwarven halls for goodies, his shipments are getting wrecked by beastmen from the Witztun hills, who seem content to trash the carts, take the animals, murder the crew, search it for weapons and scatter the rest. Duro has lost 3 of his 4 shipments to these beasts. He seeks to get some of that treasure back.

To top it off, he has failed to find any significant Mammon-marked writings. The priest will not be happy with him if he does not succeed.

### Temple of Moradin
The temple and its associated underground dwarven halls has been turned into a dungeon. Much of the finery of the dwarves has been stuffed into one room and locked.
 Things here:
* Prison where people are tortured.
* Trap chambers where poison gas fills the room while you fight zombies.
* Long hall where loyal archers can fire.
* Sleeping chamber, where Duro rests, surrounded by the dead who guard him. He doesnt trust the living too much.
