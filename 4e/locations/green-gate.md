# Green Gate Problems 

## History
* Dwarven trading city and passage from the undermountain. 
* Accessed via a wide mountain path, just widen enough for 3 lanes of heavy cart.
* Dwarves are all dead, now haunted by ghosts and the beasts from below. 
* **Dowles** and the men from **Karain** are plundering what is left of Green Gate.

## The enclave, the Order of the Scale.
* High in the mountains, some dwarves survive.
* A sect of ascetic monks, the **Order of the Scale**.
* Obsessed with justice and systems thereof, these monks acted as judges on difficult matters.
* Now they are all that is left, their training made them resistance to Mammons whispers.
* Only a fraction of their order escaped.
* Their leader, **Burrond**, is unsure where to take his people. Sentimentality ties them to these mountains.
  * He would dream of seeing the curse undone and dwarves to return to the Emerald Mountains once more.
    * but he fears he must take his people south, where they might find work and prosperity again.
  * Burrond is wracked with guilt.

## What befell the dwarves?
* Emerald dwarves had fewer compunctions about enslaving other races and openly traded slaves.
* They eventually sought different sorts of workers, to cleave the hard stone as they dug deeper.
  * They reached big chunks of impenetrable stone, but ribbed with veins of incredible gold.
* **King Yul** brought his arcane advisors on the problem.
* But a duke, **Alar** convinced **King Yul** he had a way.
* A whisper had come to him, to get the dwarves to take part in the murder of their King. 
* Eventually, **Alar** spread the whispers of the Wolf and so a dwarven city slew their just King in the name of Greed.
* The slaves they kept turned to beasts to eat them.
* The dwarves, overcome with greed, ate their treasure, ate themselves. The beasts destroyed their cities, the ghosts destroyed any survivors.
* **Alar** lives, his reward is the crown, but his kingdom is ashes. He wanders the halls of the dwarves, throughly mad.

## What befell Green Gate?
* The surface city is mostly intact, after fires and slaughter, that was a long time ago. 
  * It is a large area.
* **Burrond** in his escape, brought down the **Moradin's Shield**, sealing the main entrance to the dwarven undercity.
  * **Moradin's Shield** is a gate enchanted with ancient dwarven runes from the 3rd Age. It keeps a lot bad stuff in the dwarven halls.
  * **Moradin's Shield** is a great bronze wall, it is where the Green Gate comes from, as it is generally open and visible to all. 
* This gate still stands, 500 years later, but **Dowles** is trying to open it.
  * **Euchil** is here to stop that.
  * **Dowles** would never get through the wall on his own, but **Duro** has provided him a seer, an inscutuable hooded fella who seems to know alot about this stuff. It's gonna take a lot of blood, possibly from old dwarves aka **Burrond** himself.

## Why is the Green Gate unlooted?
* An stone golem guarded the entrance to the valley. It now lies deactivated near a bunch of dead guys anywhere from 1-500 years old.
  * The hooded guy did this.

## Encounter: The Green Gate, 1st time
* Wagons of goods driven by humans are occasionally moving up and down the path.
  * loaded down with dwarven artifacts and treasure.
  * All wagon teams are 6 guys.
* Its easy to hear people coming in the valley and there's no where to hide.

## Encounter: Euchil
* **Euchil** is a dwarven lady monk of the Order of Scale, fiercely loyal to her people.
* The peasant weapon of the dwarves is the mining pick; she wields the pick.
* She is distrustful of all folk outside her order.
* She is especially distrustful of the tiefling, whose devil blood seems similar to mammon's monsters.
* She must stop the **Moradin's Shield** from being breached, for she knows what lies on the other side, beasts and ghosts in equal measure.
* She is spying on **Dowles**.
