# The Pit History
This is an ancient eladrin site, built to house the Letarch's Key. This is one of the 4 artifacts that the ancient eladrin divided the aspect of Azathoth into, when he fell to the feywild in the age of myth. Because these pieces are so dangerous, especially together, they divided them into 4 and entrusted them to various guardians.

This site held the Letarch's Key, the summer orb. It's guardian was Viridius, a great elder green dragon. The letarch's key holds the wrath of Azathoth. 

## Pit's Construction
The Letarchian Vaults were constructed to keep the orb safe. A variety of magical traps and guardians were installed here, confusing chambers fit with riddles and passwords known only to the Eladrin themselves. (Lucan's sister spilled these beans to the Priest, on the few that she knew.) 

## The Attack
The Priest led an attack into Coyopa Forest a year ago, bringing a legion of stinking dead with her and all of her warriors and advisors. Within a month, they had the orb of summer in their hands, Viridius lay dead in the Feywild and the Learchian Vaults would become the pit, due to a big cave in during the battle. The priest has latched onto this artifact and it has increased her power significantly, but at a cost. She cannot be near the orb or unleash it fully without great pain and possibly destruction.

Story time clues:
    - Azathoth divided.
    - The 4 orbs


Goblins
- Goblins shelter in the pit.
- They don't go too far inside because it is still dangerous.
- Forest hobgoblins made by foul sorcery are here too. They are gross.
- Hobgoblin leaders may be willing to talk to PCs if they parlay.
- Chokers help these goblins lay ambushes.

Carrions crawlers
- There's a big cave in the main chamber and thousands of dead have fallen in there. The carrion crawlers are still happily munching their way through moist rotten corpses. There is a maze of natural tunnels down here that the crawlers ooze in and out of. There's also significant treasure buried in this goop. 
- There is a chest here, heavy with a great lock.
- There is much treasure here from defeated attackers.
- There are chokers and gelatiousous cubes here in the tunnels, 

Ancient magical guardians
- Iron defenders are good at protecting a controller
  - Reskinned as guardians of living wood
- Tangler beetles guard the halls, marked with runes

Another group of adventurers
- Having opened a magical barrier, a group of similar level adventurers is wounded and injured and taking their treasure back to Hope's End. The party can rob them. Or develop a friendship.
  - They are:
    - Alarldil, Elven Ranger - leader of the party, master of the spinning blades.
    - Argos, Dwarven Fighter - Dwarven pirate fighter, eyepatch, cutlass
    - Edisen, Gnomish Cleric of Garl Glittergold, purple hair and goatee, badly wounded.
    - Blue, the shardmind psion.

Secret vaults
- A illusionary barrier blocks the way to a study guarded by a great ironwood golem. He will smash anyone not saying the password as they approach. He'll ask for it. "WHAT... IS... YOUR... BUSINESS?" Answering wrong will cause him to begin dispatching beetle swarms from his bark. The password is "there's no business like fey business' but spoken in eladrin. It's the name of a popular play in Mithrendain some thousands of years ago.
- This secret is buried in the goblin treasure, an old note that says "just remember there's no business like fey business."

Viridius and his chambers
- a massive open area, now where the great orb used to sit in the center, its now missing, the room is globe shaped, the ceiling open to the air. There's heavy clouds today and a drizzle of rain.

## Overview 
There are 3 routes to the great chamber, each of them bears some difficulty. One is to engage the goblin halls fully. 

The goblins have rigged these halls with all manner of traps under the command of the hobgoblin leader, Sniks the Cunning. Keeps the goblins in line with 4 bugbears. He's not dumb, he's trying to find a way to get at the treasures below, weapons and armor and everything. He has one of the magic crossbows from the eladrin and is trying to make it work. He has a bit of an arrangement with the chokers below. The goblins live in an area of the complex meant for a garrison. There are barracks, etc. There was never a garrison stationed here, but it was built in case there was one needed. This has led Sniks to find a great number of eladrin styled items, swords, armor, etc, and his prized possession, an automated magical crossbow. He just cant seem to get it to work...
- Blade traps  
- Pit Traps  
- Ranged attacks while dealing with traps.
- Bugbear goon squad
- Sniks and retinue and a magical crossbow he's working on.

The other route is through the early pool, following that will open into a natural cavern system. The system snakes around, going up and down with numerous pitfalls, a choker haven, and a number of snakes. Mindless undead still wander around here from the fight, even a few mindful undead still wait it out here for their leader to return. It's dark here.
- Cave ins
- Slippery surfaces. 
- Chokers (and their home)
- Snakes

This route ends in the cave-in of the chamber. The cave in has loads of treasure scattered all over and thousands of dead, the stench is incredible.
- Otyghs and Carrion crawlers guard the treasure.
- Climbing up the caved in wall you can to get the upper chamber, where the fight happened and viridius was slew. It's basically in the feywild.

The other route is the main one, where you must face the overwhelming strength of the eladrin defenses has been overwhelmed with swarms of undead. It took a month to get through this stuff. Puzzles and traps, etc. There are 3 seals, each of them cracked and destroyed and the door they were attached to has been crumbled. Amid the thousands of bones, undead still linger, left behind after the Priestess claimed her prize.
This is essentially a very long corridor, expansive and impressive, with 3 great doors. The doors have been destroyed. The area is vast and open. Sound carries well in here. The first door all of the corpses are burned. Great bound fire elementals were destroyed here. The 2nd chamber was earth elementals, their rune etched bones can still be found. The 3rd was ice, but all of the ice has faded now and its dank and humid here, fungus covers everything.
- Uneven ground, covered in corpses and bones.
- Scores of undead. This the most direct route and the hardest. Any fighting will increase hordes of zombies to come lumbering from the deeper halls.
- Wights and deathlock wights are the tougher opponents, filled out with hordes of skeletons and zombie minions. 
- This can be a rush to fight through the great hall or be overwhelmed with rallying zombies. The PCs make the call. They can fight their way though too, but its very dangerous to do so.
- Stealth through will bring them to the 2nd chamber where they must get past 2 zombies. 

The Chamber
- The Chamber is where the great fight between Viridius and the forces of the Priestess took place. The air still bears a poisonous stench, a thousand dead still line the chamber floor. It is a massive dome, on the sizes are great white weathered stones. It's raining slightly, filling the chamber with drizzle. The white stones are covered in creeping plants, the zones of the pathway are broken up by grass in the cracks. 
- A 1/3 of the chamber has fallen into a great pit.
- In the center of the dome, is a great dias where the orb did sit, now darkened.
- Burned into the ground is a silhoutete of a hulking form, as if it picked up the orb and was hit with a blast of light.
- A great mass of darkened blood and scales of all sizes line the edge of the pit. 
  - Closer inspection reveals a great fight took place here. Great fire strikes are seen throughout the room, now covered up with vegetation but the stones have been burned. More of the rune etched stones of the elementals are here as well. 

- If the party is not dead or on the brink of death, there can be a boss fight there, another vampire lieutnent like Doru, but with the death knight elite package. Otherwise, let the players find some items here, weapons and armor and indicate great treasure lies below, glinting in the darkness.

- Many of the dead elites are a different type of chiche knight than we've seen:
  - Eagle warriors are the rangers, foot fighters, fighting with macualtals.
  - Jaguar warriors are mounted jungle fighters on great cats, fighting with great spears.
  - Sun warriors are line infantry. Their armor is gilded with gold, they carry spears to throw in battle. They are more lightly armored (breastplate) but carry shields. They outlast their opponents, weathering ferocious charges, and finally landing decisive blows against tired opponents.



Main plots to convey:

Viridius was killed. 
The Orb was stolen.
The priest worships a sun god.
