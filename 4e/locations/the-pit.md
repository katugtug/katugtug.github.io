# The Pit History
This is an ancient eladrin site, built to house the Letarch's Key. This is one of the 4 artifacts that the ancient eladrin divided the aspect of Azathoth into, when he fell to the feywild in the age of myth. Because these pieces are so dangerous, especially together, they divided them into 4 and entrusted them to various guardians.

This site held the Letarch's Key, the summer orb. It's guardian was Viridius, a great elder green dragon. The letarch's key holds the wrath of Azathoth. 

## Pit's Construction
The Letarchian Vaults were constructed to keep the orb safe. A variety of magical traps and guardians were installed here, confusing chambers fit with riddles and passwords known only to the Eladrin themselves. (Lucan's sister spilled these beans to the Priest, on the few that she knew.) 

## The Attack
The Priest led an attack into Coyopa Forest a year ago, bringing a legion of stinking dead with her and all of her warriors and advisors. Within a month, they had the orb of summer in their hands, Viridius lay dead in the Feywild and the Learchian Vaults would become the pit, due to a big cave in during the battle. The priest has latched onto this artifact and it has increased her power significantly. However, the orb's sunlight that it emits causes her great pain.

Story time clues:
    - Azathoth divided.
    - The 4 orbs


Goblins
- Goblins shelter in the pit.
- They don't go too far inside because it is still dangerous.
- Forest hobgoblins made by foul sorcery are here too. They are gross.
- Hobgoblin leaders may be willing to talk to PCs if they parlay.
- Chokers help these goblins lay ambushes.

Carrions crawlers
- There's a big cave in the main chamber and thousands of dead have fallen in there. The carrion crawlers are still happily munching their way through moist rotten corpses. There is a maze of natural tunnels down here that the crawlers ooze in and out of. There's also significant treasure buried in this goop. 
- There is a chest here, heavy with a great lock.

Ancient magical guardians
- Iron defenders are good at protecting a controller
  - Reskinned as guardians of living wood
- Tangler beetles guard the halls, marked with runes

Another group of adventurers
- Having opened a magical barrier, a group of similar level adventurers is wounded and injured and taking their treasure back to Hope's End. The party can rob them. Or develop a friendship.
  - They are:
    - Alarldil, Elven Ranger - leader of the party, master of the spinning blades.
    - Argos, Dwarven Fighter - Dwarven pirate fighter, eyepatch, cutlass
    - Edisen, Gnomish Cleric of Garl Glittergold, purple hair and goatee, badly wounded.
    - Blue, the shardmind psion.

Secret vaults
- A illusionary barrier blocks the way to a study guarded by a great ironwood golem. He will smash anyone not saying the password as they approach. He'll ask for it. "WHAT... IS... YOUR... BUSINESS?" Answering wrong will cause him to begin dispatching beetle swarms from his bark. The password is "there's no business like fey business' but spoken in eladrin. It's the name of a popular play in Mithrendain some thousands of years ago.
- This secret is buried in the goblin treasure, an old note that says "just remember there's no business like fey business."

Viridius and his chambers
- a massive open area, now where the great orb used to sit in the center, its now missing, the room is globe shaped, the ceiling open to the air. There's heavy clouds today and a drizzle of rain.
