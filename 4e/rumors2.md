# Rumors and shit.

## In Hopes End
1. The dead been rising round here. Graveyard is empty. Didnt used to be that way.
2.  Thrain hasn't been around, but a few desperate men have come through town from Karain.
3.  Found something interesting the other day, hunting up in Coyopa forest. Big stinking hole in the ground. Saw some torchlight in there, but man did this place smell.
4.  Up the road, there's a bunch of ruins by the lake, only thing really left is the foundations of an old temple of the waywalker. Goblins in there, you can hear em sometimes from the road.
5.  Coyopa has a big dwarf fort there, just ruins now, no dwarves.
