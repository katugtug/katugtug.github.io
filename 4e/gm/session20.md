Encounter ideas



## Foul spawn vs Deep Dwarves. 

The dwarves are being pushed back, its a race against the clock for the players to kill enough foulspawn to push them back.
2x as many foulspawn, the dwarves have been forced to retreat and lay traps in the hallway but are outnumbered.

Foulspawn are globs and glops of melted flesh, oozing with an impossible number of mouths and limbs, smelling like the air after a lightning strike. The dwarves have fought them for thousands of years and have methods of defeating them. They are the foul spawn, monsters who emerged from a great rift and forced them into the prime world.

They were late to the founding of the great Emerald Halls, but took it as their duty to hold the Deep Way from foulspawn. They did for centuries.

The dwarves are from beyond the Deep Way, ancient members of the clan Hallowhall and Longpath. Jorgin Hallowhall is the leader of this group. He knows of the 3 clans who opened the deepway 400 years ago and when their watch ended. Hallowhall and Longpath have stayed and defend a settlement known as the Glitterhold, whilst the other dwarves have made their way back down the ways, seeking out the other dwarves of the Continent, the southern dwarves who fight the Scourge.

Jorgin will talk to the players apprehensively, but will be easier by the Dwarf Ferus Deepriver, who he will trust. 

## Shifter entourage

A group of shifters are looking for Ix Chel and have followed her here, having arrived in Hope's End about 2 weeks ago. The shifter that leads this group is Eztli, a shifter ranger. Some time has passed since Ix Chel left and now the lands of the shifters are being encroached on by the walking dead. The shifter queen asks, but does not demand, Ix Chel's return to the homeland. Her knowledge of the undead and how to fight them would be invaluable to her people. 

The shifters are encountered fighting with some of the Shadur Kai, the vampires helpers. They fight upon a bridge over a vast chasm.
