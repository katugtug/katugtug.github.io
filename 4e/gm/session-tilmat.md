As you enter the plaza, the great dwarven gate stands before you. On either side, 2 great stone statues, now covered in white bird excrement, one of Moradin, the other of Berronar. Each stares down at the entranceway. Across this great entrance way, some 100 feet wide, lie the remains of the green gate. Great shards of it still stand, each carved in thousands of tiny runes by a dwarven hands. It now lies sundered and burned, as if a great fiery explosion blew it to smithereens.

A great circle has been carved into the dwarven flag stones and all weeds and dirt cleared. There was something written here, but it was spent when the spell fired. The carving into the stone is molten in parts, obsidian colored and glassy once who you dust it off. At the center of the intricately carved circle lies a small pile of cracked glass. Closer inspection reveals a gemstone of some kind. 

A great mass of bodies is being feasted on my crows. Closer inspection reveals a hundreds or so robed individuals with their rib cages split open and their hearts removed.

At last, outside of the circle, conspicuously cleared away, a pair of silver shackles, unlocked, have been placed on the stone.

Nearing them, Tilmat appears, standing above the shackles.
