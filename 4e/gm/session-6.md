#Strong Start
The collapsing temple of Moradin.

Deep below the Temple of Moradin, you stand in the former priest's quarters, looking and storing away the items found here.

The temple begins to rumble, a pillar near you fractures and crumbles, bringing a shower of stones from above. It's clear that this temple is coming down and you need to get out.

## Skill Challenge:
Athletics - to lift heavy things, climb things
Acrobatics - dodge falling rocks and cross tight surfaces
Endurance - to run up many flights of stairs as fast as possible.

The ceiling is falling, you need to run, claw and fight your way out.

The first room is the massive room, now with most of the floor gone, the giant temple of Moradin and the ceremonial forge. Big chains hang down.

The next room is the chasm, zombies are here, wandering around. Stealth is good.

The final room is the chimney room, the roof is collapsing, big heavy chunks of stone pepper the room. Acrobatics is good.

Other options:
History for dwarven stuff, perhaps a secret door?
Heal to help someone with a sprained ankle.
Bluff to distract the zombie horde.
Nature to smell a way out.

# Part 2

- The players emerge gasping from the temple as it collapses, right into a waiting mob of onlooking Duro men.
  - About 20
  - Batu is there in the background.

- Motivation for the mob is money.

- The are concerned mainly if Duro is dead.
  - One of the ladies, Ludwend, steps forward, claiming these guys are gonna run off with all of Duro's loot. Let's take it from them.
  - Lots of people agree. This is a social challenge.
  - She'll step down if public turns against her.
  
#Potential Scenes 
## TO THE GATE
- The players make their way up the road to green gate and encounter beastmen on the road. 
- The players enter into the Outer Emerald City, seeing this massive structure, now covered in vines and grass.
- The players encounter some of Dowles men, looking for dwarves specifically. 
- The players encounter a dwarven scout, Euchil, she tries to escape.

## TO THE WEST
- This area is staked out by a isolationalist group of minotaurs who crash landed here centuries ago. Driven in land over time by the drake folk of the coasts and unable to make way in the thousands of miles of marsh, they make their home here at the foot of the mountains. They are savage warriors with a matriachal society who worship an snake idol. They practice a form of sacrifice where they feed outsiders to a giant snake pit in the center of their temple area. They have killed the orcs in the area.
- There is a priest character, Omani, a female minotaur.
- There is a warrior guard, Uxo, a great fighter and loyal to Omani.
- There is a scholar who remembers where they came from, he has a book from the original captain of the original voyage.
- The minotaurs will force the players into the southern forests.
- Most forms of flattery and diplomacy will end in them being tricked and fed to the snake. ( no weapons in the temple area, etc)


## FANTASTIC LOCATIONS

### Green Gate
Great dwarven towers guard several lanes of road which lead through 6 12 foot gates. Above the gates, a massive gatehouse, from which the gates can be raised and lowered. The towers are some 100 ft in diameter and just as tall, octagonal in shape. You get the first character of the dwarves here. The tall towers are adorned with great iron gibbets, ancient bleached bones are still visible high above. Several iron golems lie rusting and over grown with grass and vines. 2 of them look a lot more recent.

# Where to? 

Review stuff with players. Get map back out. What do?

- Trial of the Bard - Discuss that we should role play this, putting aside the fact that Tom is in the game, etc. Are you willing to allow it to continue? Now is the time to kick him out of the group, fight him, etc. Or force him to make some agreement.

- Head back to Hope's End to rest up, trade, research.
  - There's a mage who trades in residduum here, he will disenchant your items for you and create now ones below level 10 for you.

- Coyopa Forest - the mysterious guy.
  
- Green Gate
