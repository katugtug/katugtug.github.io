# The Primes
Ages ago, a great meteor fell into the Feywild, a being of incredible power from beyond space and time. A terrible destroyer, the being was known as Azathoth, the Maker of Ruins, for all he touched crumbled, all who heard his song were unmade.

So the eladrin gathered, and from their meeting was hatched a plan. At great sacrifice of life, they defeated Azathoth and divided him into four. His wrath was put into the Letarch's Key, the Orb of Summer. His vitality was given into the into the Vesitarch, the Rites of Spring. His hunger was put into the Zimurium, a great beast. And finally, his weakness was divided into the Jes-ai, a race of people native to the Feywild. 

To each of these was assigned a guardian, Viridius, a great dragon was to guard the the key/ the summer orb.

The vesitarch was written to the shell of a great turtle, Ghor and Ghor was free to roam the sea, passing between the seas of the feywild and the prime world with ease.

To guard the great Zimurium, Vladros, master of beasts and warden of winter and later Vladros the Betrayer would see to the needs of the Zimurium.

And finally, the weakness of Azathoth was given to the Jes-ai. They were guarded by a spirit known as the Shifter of Ways.
