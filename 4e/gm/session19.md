# Session 19

## Level 3

### The Vault
It has been opened and there is nothing inside. A layer of dust has settled over everything.

### The Order of the Scale
  - The entry hall
    - A fight with Tli Xahcecs guards, one runs to warn him, kill him before he gets there to not give Tli fair warning.
  - The library
    - Here great stacks of tablets and scrolls chart the entirely of the law and justice of the emerald halls.
    - Basic topics to learn about:
      - **The Order of the Scale**
        - Judges guild, a group of scholars who forsake their clanhood for the good of all dwarves.
        - Because a dwarfs only true loyalty is to his clan and the clan bonds are stronger than even filial ones, dwarves cannot be trusted to fairly judge themselves through juries.
        - The order of the scale allows dwarven clans to settle disputes without war.
        - Order of the Scale monks do not have children, because they are without clan.
        - Led by Burrond, a dwarf of 200 years.
      - **Dwarven calendar**
        - Years measured by gestation period, which turns into roughly 11 months.
        - Influx of groundwater from above ground precipitation means that post-Blackrock dwarves have also been subject to the yearly surface calendar.
      - **The history of the halls**
        - Dwarves before the Congress of Blackrock lived in the deephome, the ancestral birthplace of all dwarves. 
        - The properties of the deephome are different than the the material world, in a similar way to the Feywild or the Shadowfell. The deephome is the dwarven portion of the underdark in confluence with elemental earth.
        - Things like molten amber were common in deephome. Only the amber which has survived the exodus still remains.
        - Legends of the dwarven halls with solid gold walls, of perfect jewels that glow with an inner light, of adamantine fortresses long abandoned fill the books.
        - The dwarves are forced from their homes by an invading army known as the foulspawn.
        - A great rift opened in deephome and from that fissure, an army of aberrations emerged. The dwarves fought valiantly for centuries, but the attack did not cease. After the great hero Glandor Ironhall led an army in to the rift and was swallowed up without a trace, it became clear the dwarves could not fight this menace.
        - The congress of blackrock was called, all the dwarven clans were invited and 65 clan representatives made it.
        - The dwarven congress lasted a decade. Eventually, it was decided that the dwarves must move skyward or face complete annihilation. 
      - **The Dwarven clans**
        - Of the 65 clans of the Congress of Blackrock in 15,640 DW, 30 were to head to the emerald halls. Of those 30, only 21 clans arrived. In 16,102 DW, the deep way was sealed by the Deepspring clan, sealing off the 9 clans who had not made it.
      - **the recent history of the vault**
        - The vault is a perfect sphere of green metal whose surface cannot be scratched by sword or sorcery. 
      - **current events before the collapse**
        - Burrond has been working on a contract, a great work, that apparently has been inscribed on a bronze sheet by a dwarf named Gorik, an advisor of arcane matters to King Yul. The contract has already been sealed with the clan signets of 20 of the clans.
        - Burrond bemoans this in his notes, he wasn't properly consulted, the clan heads signed the document before he was allowed to look at it.
        - It is mostly concerned with the parting out of shares of the treasure from inside the vault when it is opened. 
        - It covers the great cost and needs for Gorik to put his plan into motion. A grand locus of magical energy, which will require reagents from all over the world. 
        - Burrond in his final notes on the subject before they abruptly end are as follows:
          - "Something continues to bother me of this great tablet. Not simply the malprudence of Gorik, but of the tablet itself. It is illuminated in a strange manner, with symbols to which I cannot find any reference in the Order's library. I cautioned the king, but he is driven with ..... *Burrond has scratched a word out* I'll continue my work at deciphering these strange symbols. I truly wish they'd come to me before they'd signed it. Are they not aware of the Order's function? It is in this thing **especially**; these needs **specifically**. We should work to reassert the Order's role in these matters going forward, so badly declined in the present day" - Burround, 99th of 24,380 
          - "I found one of the symbols in a dusty tome which dates before the exodus. It is a book of folk stories, transcribed from the oral history of Wanderers before the first founding. It is the seal of Maedon the Gilded One, one of the 9 dwarves cast out during the Wandering, doomed to be clanless and to die alone for their sins. By Grungi's beard! What is Gorik up to?" -- Burrond, 120th of 24,380

Tli Xahcec is here, searching for the contract. As the players arrive, he has found it. It is a great tablet, he has erected 5 stellae to aid in the teleportation ritual.

The order of scale is a great library. 
These are definitely Shadur Kai, vampire thralls standins.
Fights in the Order of the scale involve lots of bookcases.
