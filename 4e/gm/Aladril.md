# Aladril the Elven Ranger

The scion of a great elven noble family, Aladril has lived for centuries in his forest home, reading the wind and rain and the tracks of animals like a great map. His deep green elven cloak is perfectly stitched with silver thread, embroidered with the faint motif of leaves. At his side, two silver hilted swords, one a wolf pommel, the other of the rabbit. He is a powerful fighter when moved to draw them. On his back there is a elven bow of white wood and a quiver filled with colorfully fletched arrows. 

Aladril is lost in thought most of the time, his mind stretched over centuries of memories. His business, such as why he keeps his present company, is his own.
