# Dwarven Halls 

You enter the dwarven halls, the entrance way is grand and powerful, like a cathedral. The smell is old and dusty. The echos stretch on forever. While perhaps beautiful when lit with the great dwarven fires, the place now feels clausterphobic and scary. Each rattled bone echoes for seconds through the great dark tunnels.

Entrance way leads to a few different destinations with some searching, a waystone can be found. That indicates a basic path to each of the places.
