# Dwarven Halls 

You enter the dwarven halls, the entrance way is grand and powerful, like a cathedral. The smell is old and dusty. The echos stretch on forever. While perhaps beautiful when lit with the great dwarven fires, the place now feels clausterphobic and scary. Each rattled bone echoes for seconds through the great dark tunnels.

Dwarf fights dwarf in these halls, and something that used to be a dwarf. Dead bones reveal mutants with snarling predatory teeth but sharing other anatomical similarities with dwarves.

Entrance way leads to a few different destinations with some searching, a waystone can be found, but much of it has been destroyed. That indicates a basic path to each of the places.

Guild halls
- Order of the Scale - Level 3
    - Tli Xahcec is here, searching for the contract. As the players arrive, he has found it. H
    - The order of scale is a great library, now guarded by undead wights, lieutentants of Tli Xahcec.
    - These are definitely Shadur Kai, vampire thralls standins.
    - Fights in the Order of the scale involve lots of bookcases.
- Artificers Guild - Level 2
  - The artificers guild is guarded by a number of automations, who has kept everything pristine inside. They rattle around in disrepair, guarding the outside in a simple patrol, their feet wearing down the flagstones over 500 years. All attacks by these guys have a chance of failure. 
    - (one of them has a spent flamethrower)
    - From the books one might learn:
      - Description of molten amber, how it is found and how to use it. A great number of automation parts.
      - Molten amber is mined from the deep parts of the earth and is a magical reageant to make automaton brains. More amber = more capacity to hold thoughts and less lost in the transfer.
      - More common in the underdark than here. Much of the research here is to get as much as they can out of the little amber they have brought, that means less smart constructs that use less amber.
      - There is 4 lbs of molten amber scattered around, enough to instill a 100 automations with base intelligence, or to install 10 with enough amber to think and consider. The ritual also costs
      - There is mention here of an attempt to open some sort of 'vault'.
      - There is a ritual to make automations, a ritual to make more fuel, and a ritual to infuse golden amber into metalminds.
- Brewer's Guild - Level 1
  - The smell of spilled beer and riotous laughter greets your eats as a well lit brewery comes into view. Great tanks line the chamber, as a great brewing operation used to happen here.
    - Where Dowles has holed up, he has to keep his men drunk.
    - Dowles will turn on Tli Xahcec but only if he believes you can kill him. He lives in fear. 
      - it is credible that Xahcec can hunt him down should he betray him.
    - He might help the players if he is convinced they came to kill Tli Xahcec, not simply wound him. 
- Engineers Guild - Level 1
    - The dwarves who opened the Deep Way decided to do so from here, using the secrets of the Darkspring clan. 
    - They left notes and signed a pact.
      - We face an enemy that axe and hammer will not kill.
      - The minds of our kin are mad with hunger.
      - Our clans must leave, our survival depends on it, and may Moradin bless our wayward souls.
      - Using the secrets of the Darkspring clan, we will open the Deepway and make our path into the old world.
      - May Berronar keep us safe, despite our betrayal, so that her children may live on.
        - Signed Eirik Glassforge, Boron Deepriver, and Alexandra Darkspring.
- House of the Grand Council - level 2
    - Seat of the king and meeting place of the law making body. 
    - Gorik the Betrayer is here, sit upon the throne, still alive, a 5 foot beard goes to his feet. A smashed automaton lies nearby.
    - How... are you here?
    - Why... have you come to this cursed place? 
    - Burrond did this...
- Mortuary Guild - level 1 
  - Secrets of gentle repose are here. A ritual that costs 25gp per body.
  - The curse happened so fast that no dwarves were properly buried. The tables are clean, the supplies basically unused. There are embalming supplies 50 lbs.
- Runesmith and Temple Complex - level 1.
  - The scribes here have recorded in some depth the appearance of the vault and the burning facination that it caused. Inventors, magicians, runesmiths, priests, warriors, lined up to open it up. But none could. It became the most important thing in the Emerald Halls for a time.
 
An elevator is here, a system of locks and water pumps work to raise very heavy loads from the lower depths. 

The history of the dwarves:
- King Yul is a good king.
- They discover the vault, an green metal clad cube, seemingly without an entrance. 
- None can figure it out and time passes.
- Driven by madness, Gorik, advisor to the council, starts to hear and see dreams that describe a way into the vault. 
- Eventually they become very clear.
- He writes a contract, word for word, from revelation of the dreams.
- He uses every apparatus available to him to get all heads of the council of clans to sign it. Some he extorts, other he blackmails, others he bribes, others he barters. Eventually all clans are willing to sign, except for the Blackbeards, their lead Titania Blackbeard, will never sign.
- The blackbeards are exiled skyward, a great and terrible mark on their clan. They all leave.
- upon signing of the contract, the curse of mammon is upon them, but none attack Gorik, he's cursed with eternal life for the treasure of the vault, which, of course, is empty, its door now stands open.
- The contract curses entire clans - it works off of clan lines and the Priest hopes to harness her own curse to curse the families of nobles who still oppose her, when they are lured into a peace process. They will inadvertenly sign away their blood lines just as the dwarves did.
