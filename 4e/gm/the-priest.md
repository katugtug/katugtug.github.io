# Priest History

The Priest is name of Tli Chel, an ancient vampire lord. Originally a devout priest of the Sun in the Sky, Tli Chel had visions of the sun burning humanity from the face of the earth her entire life. She carried on.

She was at the Last Council / The Blood Council when the artifact was unveiled, turning all present into the vampires we know today. She survived the bloodshed, savagely. And escaped to the southern kingdoms. For the last century, the Kingdoms of Tolec have been the Vampire Kingdoms.

No longer able to feel the warmth of her god, she went mad.

In time, this was a century ago, she acquired some measure of political power and eventually seized the city of Vex Utu.

Seeing her visions as a test, as a way towards redemption, she seeks to remove mankind from the face of the earth, seeing them as a failed creation of the Gods, who want to start over. She is the instrument of the Sun in the Sky. 

The sun in the sky still grants her divine magic. Maybe it's not Pelor?

# Present Day

* She is the defacto ruler of Vex Utu. 
  * She controls directly or indirectly most forms of day to day life in the Vex Utu area.
* She is a ruthless leader. 

* Most of her lieutenants are vampires, though not all. (she needs to do stuff during the day)
* The day LT's work to please her to be turned into a vampire.

* She is building an army of undead. 
  * The city of Vex Utu is plagued by thousands of unintelligent undead roaming around. 
  * She is constructing a great temple, a massive ziggurat, the largest ever seen, to honor her god. Zombies as salves.
  * Her goal is to walk in the sun once more, by appealing to the Sun in the Sky, honoring him with blood and death to prove her worth (He is the Sun, not Pelor, a mighty god of both life and outright destruction.)

# Vampires
* Vampires can make vampire thralls. They have similar powers and weaknesses to vampires, but are blood bound to their master.. 
  * Vampires must willingly free them from her control, in which case they may grow powerful enough to make thralls of their own. 
* Vampires can make wights, who serve as their day to day soldiers and can crutially go out in sunlight. Whatever they were in life, little remains, they become hate filled officers of the undead, cruelly executing their master's will.
* Vampire thralls can create undead. Tons of zombies, a handful of smarter skeletons.
