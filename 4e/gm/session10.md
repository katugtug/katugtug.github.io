# Session 10: the fight in the pit continues

Davos   - loyal knights lay in heaps, PTSD
Zeth    - The remains of a portal to the feywild can be seen.
Ramsas  - Who are you sired from? Sun gods?
Ix Chel - Armor and weapons made from a dead dragon could prove useful.

Around the chamber are discarded and broken green scales, covered in ancient blood.
A great claw can be seen, severed. The death knight has it.
A great scroll is found, severed in two.
It is a chronicle of the building of a great ediface in the city of Vex Utu, a gleaming tower of
polished stone, a monument to the Great Sun. It is shown to the north.
