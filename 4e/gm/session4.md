# Session 4 Afteraction

Party convinces Batu and Perimy to spill some beans. Batu will come with them, but Perimy ends up escaping in the night. He's in the wind, maybe he goes to meet up with Dowles. They walk straight to the temple and try to climb the chimney but are caught. They fight a number of guards and some dogs. 

They descend the chimney and find their way into a big dwarven room filled with zombies. They kill them all

They fight their way across a narrow bridge with a few ranged defenders and traps.

They find their way past a thick wooden door into the chamber of Doru. Skeleton warriors defend Doru; warriors from his tribe he has brought with him.
