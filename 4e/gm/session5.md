# Encounter Setup

## Description


## GM Notes
* Size of the board
* Magic circle around a sarcophagus, runes in salt on the floor.
* As the sacrophagus opens, beetle swarms come out. There are 1d3 swarms in there. 
* This was a dwarven place of worship, to the back is a big forge, long cold, that was used in ceremony, not for work. The tools are ritualized.
* In the lower area, the skeleton guards stand. These warriors are of the Chiche. These were followers of Doru in life and he's brought them with him in dead.

As the skeletons fall, the bones behind to rattle and skitter across the floor. The sacrophagus cracks open and hundreds of beetles scurry unto the floor while the bones come together in a massive creature, wielding 4 weapons.

# Wave 3 
The sacrophagus lid falls off. A thickly muscle, dark skinned man, his body covered in black tattoos, wearing teeth and bones and feathers, steps from the sacrophagus. This is Doru.

If the magic circle stands, he protected from all but the Eladrin. 

He will talk, maybe even come to a deal. He has a lot of problems that need solving. He is chiche, there are lots of this sort of people. But he doesn't speak like Batu, he speaks as a nobleman, though an angry and tempermental one.

Otherwise he will fight. He is a wight with vampire tendencies.
