# Characters
Lucan, eladrin avenger
- Knows of Zeth's patron.

Zeth, tiefling warlock
- Easier chance to recognize the magic circle.
- A black diamond appears in Zeth's hand. It eats vampires. When they turn to mist, it sucks them in, in a spectacular fashion. It opens a great black icy cold rift, she steps out. A "faerie with pale, angular features, blood-black eyes, and a mane of black hair. She is beautiful, but hers is a terrible, eldritch beauty that chills the bone." The ground turns to ice where she walks, lights flicker and dim. She pulls the now-substantial vampire into the portal effortlessly, as she disappears, the warmth returns to the room in a rush.
  
Juras, human bard
- Juras should start having dreams after witnessing the terrible angular beauty of the Ice Queen.

Ix Chel, shifter warden
- Loves killing vampires.

# Encounter Setup

## Description


## GM Notes
* Size of the board
* Magic circle around a sarcophagus, runes in salt on the floor.
* As the sacrophagus opens, beetle swarms come out. There are 1d3 swarms in there. 
* This was a dwarven place of worship, to the back is a big forge, long cold, that was used in ceremony, not for work. The tools are ritualized.
* In the lower area, the skeleton guards stand. These warriors are of the Chiche. These were followers of Doru in life and he's brought them with him in death. The wizard will retreat beyond the circle in a pinch.
* A swirl of malevolence strikes at the players from outside the map, swooping in and spectral barraging.

## Cool things to interact with
* In piles in the corners are a number of ruined pews and tables.
* Behind the center dias, there is a door to another room, the priest's chambers.
* 1 large dwarven statue stands aside the great forge. The gems and gold have been removed from him. 
* A great gilded chain hangs from the ceiling 30 ft up, something

# Wave 2 - old dwarves and beetles from above
Remnants of previous encounter and lots of minions

The floor rumbles and shakes as the dwarven catacombs are split open by necromantic magic. The room subdivides into 3 planes with cracks in between, and from below, the dwarven buried dead emerge, scores of decrept skeletons, as the players make their way to doru's sacrophagus. The great moradin statue heaves and falls, making an unstable bridge between the top sacrophagus level and the lower levels.

Pieces of the temple above come collapsing in, a single shaft of sunlight can be seen as the rubble collapses above. 

Acrobatics checks for balance are required for the bridge up to the sacrophagus and for the 3rd plane.

# Wave 3 begins
When players reach 3rd level

The sacrophagus lid falls off. A powerful warrior steps out, huge in statue and girth. He is of the Eagle Warrior school. He wears glittering scale mail, still polished and gleaming in the torch light. His weapon is the macuahuitl, which he wields two of. They thick hafted wooden weapons, with steel blades instead of obsidian. They are exotic weapons with a crit range of 19-20 and do 1d8 damage. These specific ones are magical +1 versions but this isn't included in his stats. 

He will talk, maybe even come to a deal. He has a lot of problems that need solving. 
- The road is choked with beasts, clearing those helps everyone. 
- The dwarven hall are locked, he can split some of the treasure. 
- There is no need to fight. There is gold and treasure to go around. 
- His main this is getting the beasts off the roads, which he will reward the players for their success.
- Diplomacy doesn't do a ton here, is already quite diplomatic.

He is chiche, there are lots of this sort of people. But he doesn't speak like Batu, he speaks as a nobleman, though an angry and tempermental one.

Potential for the help from spirit of Moradin or Euchil, the monk here if the players need help in the fight.

2 Rat Swarms, counts as beetles (level 2) 125xp ea 
1 Boneshard Skeleton - 200xp
1 Doru, 5th level wight skirmisher with twin strike, and a blood drain on combat advantage.  He has some extra HP.

    Blood Drain (standard; recharges when an adjacent creature becomes bloodied) ✦ Healing Requires combat advantage; +13 vs. Fortitude; 2d12 + 8 damage, the target is weakened (save ends), and the vampire lord regains 46 hit points; see also combat advantage. R
 
    Dominating Gaze (minor; recharge ⚅ ) ✦ Charm Ranged 5; +13 vs. Will; the target is dominated (save ends, with a –2 penalty on the saving throw). Aftereff ect: The target is dazed (save ends). The vampire lord can dominate only one creature at a time.

If the magic circle stands, he protected from all but the Eladrin. He will fire at the players with a bow while they try to work him over.

Otherwise he will fight. He is a wight with vampire tendencies.
