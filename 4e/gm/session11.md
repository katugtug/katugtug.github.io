- Leaving the dungeon, all of the horses have been stolen by the goblins that escaped in the beginning.
- Half of the scrolls appear to be an accounting of a building of a great structure in the Chiche city of Vex Utu.

Back to hope's end. What has happened?

- Anton Wroughtiron has returned, hes to set out north. He is friends with Iviss Blimth, he can travel with the party for a ways.
- The dead still rise here, something has changed and gotten worse. More undead attack the city than ever, a militia has been formed and a watch on the main road has to be kept.
- A wall is being constructed around Hope's End, Michel is helping. Its a wooden pallisade.


Lucan's funeral - the body slowly goes back to the feywild over time. Iviss can say some words.
A new merchant has come into town, who is basically a franchise for a powerful mages guild, the Emporium of Aradan. He can buy and sell magic items from a vast selection of items. His name is Horace, the accountant, he's a gnome, he will give 1/5 book value in gold.


## In the cracked flagon

  - But there is a vault down there, something that fell from above in that dome, it's locked up, it must have somethng inside.
  - (return to the Pit for treasure)
- Beastmen plague the roads up north. Terrible creatures who eat travellers for food.

- Arrow lake has, beneath its surface, a number of caves, the head of a cult to the snake god, Zehir. Fighting through the caves of snakes and cultists will come to a chamber with a big snake who sacrifices are fed to and that has the last renmants of the ancient Yuanti temples. Lots of gold, poison related magic items. Stamping this temple out will stop the Yuanti plot. The Yuanti are led by a half snake man cultist who will parlay with the party in exchange for safe passage into the north. He is half snake and has a number of guards who he will want to come.
