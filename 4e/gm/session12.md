## Strong start
As the party approaches the ruins of the wagon, they notice bandits picking through the remains, looting what is left.

## Potential scenes
The party discovers the wagon site. It's been sacked and its stuff carried off. Tracks lead to the southeast (arrow lake).

Bandits are investigating the wagon when the players arrive. A group of 5 bandits, but another hides in the nearby woods.

Hiding in the bushes, a lone child has lost his parents.

The lake is beautiful in the afternoon heat, calm glacial water. A few small huts can be made out along the surface.

Reaching the edge of arrow lake, a small fishing shanty, inside a man dead of a poisonous snake bite. Evidence of a family are here but all are missing.

Tracks lead to a small cave which leads to an underground cave system that seems to go under the arrow lake

You enter the cavern and your torch light reveals thousands and thousands of snakes, slitherng across the floor. Rope snakes, not poisonous, but annoying.

The inside of the cavern turns to a small lake, there is no other way in - you must swim forward in order to succeed. The water is ice cold, the swim isn hard but you cant stay in the water long without going into shock.

The passages narrow, you hear the screams of a woman from deep in the caves.

One guard stands with his spear, guarding a passageway, torchlight can be made out, snakes slither at your feet. Water drips ominously, forming puddles

The screams of the woman abruptly end, she has been swallowed whole.

You enter into a circular cavern, here a priest in scales, surrounded by human followers, feeds a prisoner to a giant snake. The torchlight reveals another here, Juras.

Profile: YIG, priest of Zehir. He is in his 30s, a human, his flesh has been wracked by sores, but half of his face now bears snake skin instead of human skin. He can ritually split his tongue, but can still talk fine. 
- Yig came from the human kingdoms, a nobleman who bore a terrible curse, all of his children died. When the priests of Kord he paid could not heal him, saying the curse was a spiritual affliction more so than a physical one, he sought other means, eventually meeting a being he calls only the illuminator in the dark Freehaven night, who told him of a place in the north where he may find his true calling, drawn to north, he wandered on a spirit quest, until he was led here and met The Great One. 
- Juras stands here, playing a weakling, he has information about how to travel north. He is playing a nerd, who discovered a secret pass through the mountains in an old dwarven book. He has learned the snakes want to go north, Yig will be hesitant to reveal this.
