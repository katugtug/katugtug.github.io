# Argos the Dwarven Fighter 

As tan as leather with a wirey black beard tied into knots and a balding head, Argos is an adventuring dwarf. He's covered in sailor tattoos, his arms and armor upkept to the highest standards but showing their age.  We carries a great falchion in the style of the Steppe lords.
