# Grunstadt confederation

**Lurzig** is the seat of the crown and the capital of the [Grunstadt confederation]({% link zweihander/grunstadt.md %}). The confederation consists of 5 total states, all supporting **King Maxwell Herrscher** in fealty and his central authority radiates from **Lurzig**. **Lurzig** is a port city. Goods from the southern half of the continent make their way here and from here catch the trade winds out into the **Far Sea**, a body of water that stretches to unknown lands to the east and the other 2 continents to the north. **Lurzig** is an idea setting out point for voyages to the east, but none have ever returned and few, excepting perhaps the king himself, will finance such a thing.
