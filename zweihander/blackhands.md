# Candle cults

There are many candle cults in the world, and several even in Lurzig. Those with the gift can stare into the flickering flame of specially prepared candles and in the dark, they may see images, feel emotions and hear worlds through the flicking flames. Candle cultists in this way can communicate across great distances. Their messages must be encoded however in a sort of poetry and so in many cases, while the messages may be received, it must also be decoded and translated into useful information. Nevertheless, the candle cult services are in high demand amongst traders, merchants, warlords and kings.

## The Blackhands

The blackhands are a candle cult in the city of **Lurzig** led by a local coal mine baron, now turned spiritualist, Luthor Vuwa (vuu-wah). The coal miners are coquillially called blackhands and so the name, as a tounge and cheer reference, has stuck to Vuwa's new followers.
