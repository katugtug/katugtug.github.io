# Candle cults

There are many candle cults in the world, and several even in Lurzig. Those with the gift can stare into the flickering flame of specially prepared candles and in the dark, they may see images, feel emotions and hear worlds through the flicking flames. Candle cultists in this way can communicate across great distances. Their messages must be encoded however in a sort of poetry and divine language and so in many cases, while the messages may be received, it must also be decoded and translated into useful information. Nevertheless, the candle cult services are in high demand amongst traders, merchants, warlords and kings. 

## The Blackhands

The Blackhands are a candle cult in the city of **Lurzig** led by a local coal mine baron, now turned spiritualist, Luthor Schelger. In his travels, Schelger found something. In one of his mines, an ancient tablet from a bygone age, crafted from ancient untarnished steel. He took it and finding nothing for all of his looking, he turned to prayer and the barely understood art of the candle cults. Messages from the candle seers regarding the tablet whipped the Schelger and his band into a frenzy of anticipation. A thing beyond reckoning would arrive soon, and they would be its welcoming hosts. 

Schelger soon disappeared from public life. He would no longer be seen at public galas and dinners. It's said that none of the moneies from his mines even reach him any longer, so mismanaged and subject to local influence as they are. But Schelger is consumed with another purpose; to harken the age of the Hallowed, ruled by the two headed lord of gold, Nimnar. 

The Blackhands are a candle cult primarily concerned with the work of Schelger and his maniac visions. They make their bases in the now shut down mines of Schelger's former mining empire. Their primary purpose is to seek seers and gather knowledge. They kill and steal, using their great resources to buy off the authorities whilst preying on scholars young and old. They seek any other relics of Nimnar, the two headed golden god. A network of Blackhands all over the continent communicate with each other through the candles.
