# Scattered Brass Handout
 
Scatter'd bits, scatter'd bits
    lying in the street
a bit you for and a bit for me
    lets get something to eat

The year is 1582 from the Founding. The common folk, wronged and robbed, cling to superstition for succor. Disease runs rampant in the cities. Men and women are shipped off to wars in far away lands, only to return mutilated, traumatized and broken... if they return at all. All manner of villainy lurks in people's hearts, as they strive to overcome each other with either violence or treachery. The gods are fickle, if not cruel. Priests are charlatans. Sages are mostly mad. At the edges of civilization, talk of monstrosities unknown strike fear into the hearts of men, circling the light of civilization like a camp fire.

Into this world, you were born. You've found your way to the city of Lurzig or you were born in it. It's a port city and home to 150,000 souls. It's crowded, rapidly growing and choked with commerce. 

Social strata are set in stone in the cities of the Grunstadt. Your birth determines your place in society and its rarely shook off. 

## Lurzig
**Lurzig** is the seat of the crown and the capital of the **Grunstadt** confederation. The confederation consists of 5 total states, all supporting **King Maxwell Herrscher** in fealty and his central authority radiates from **Lurzig**. **Lurzig** is a port city. Goods from the southern half of the continent make their way here and from here catch the trade winds out into the **Far Sea**, a body of water that stretches to unknown lands to the east and the other 2 continents to the north. **Lurzig** is an idea setting out point for voyages to the east, but none have ever returned and few, excepting perhaps the king himself, will finance such a thing.

The port of the city is its beating heart. Hundreds of ships pass through in a season, bringing goods and people from distant lands as well as their poxes and plagues. The **shipworkers union** is a powerful entity in Lurzig, wielding a softer power, but a power nonetheless, that is second only to the crown. 

The city supports a bustling upper class as well. It's higher end markets filled with goods from the continent, expensive shops dot the edge of the finely paved plaza, set with statues and fountains depicting the gods and kings and heroes of the Grunstadt. 

For most though, entrance to the plaza is not attainable. They toil away in the cities many factories, working in awful conditions, but providing finished goods for export. Many old trades are being replaced by factories, drawing more and more people to live in these city conditions.

The climate in **Lurzig** is temperate, but can reach very high temps in the summer months when hot air from the plains pushes in. In winter, it is cold and wet, but sea ice is never a concern.

Magic in **Lurzig** that doesn't originate from the religious orders of **the Three** is considered dangerous at best and foul at worst. The King's **Arcanium**, both an organization and a location, monitors the magick use in the city and all of the Grunstadt. Petty magick is tolerated but frowned upon. Cloaked mage hunters, covered in the anti-magick warding tattoos, seek out renegade magick users who cross prescribed lines. The mage hunters are feared as much as the renegade mages themselves.
