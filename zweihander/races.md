**Halflings** - Halflings still ply their trades in the central continent as they always have. There is no halfling nation and no halfling lords. The lands they work are considered not their own. Halflings are exceptional farmers, their techniques go back centuries. Without any sort of martial tradition however, they find themselves the victims more often than not. Even so, in the central farmlands, the halflings life proceeds as it has for centuries.

Some halflings have moved to the cities, like Lurzig, for one reason or another. They have an exceptional aptitude from larceny, due to their small size. They have a reputation as pick pockets and thieves. Halflings can own property in Lurzig, but not all cities. Many are inn keepers, shop keepers. They are not well known as craftsmen. 

Halflings more than anything are survivors. Tough, dogged folk. While they do not fight, they do survive by adapting to different ways of life in diffeent parts of world.

**Ogres / Half Orcs** - The race of folk known as half orcs are also known as ogres. In the bitter cold of the south west, the sons of Malik sought a new way to govern themselves. The orcish nobility founded many cities and spread law and prosperity throughout the south east of the continent. The houses never trusted each other however, and minor rifts developed into feuds and feuds became wars which divided and burned much of that prosperity. The merchants rarely venture out here, for there is little to export and the dangers are high. As such, the ogre folk make war as they always have in the tradition of their forefathers.
