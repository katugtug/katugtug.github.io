blood in the air is the way of the thing
the last of a dying interest

what is  this thing that i feel there is no stop to the thing that i feel
I am here now, alone but with purpose. do you know my purpose?

a city of lurzig, a black place, a yawning pit to fill with nothing that drains from empty rivers.
the dwarf tells me of his nothing, oh his great terror, oh his great sacrifice, but it is nothing indeed, for no one cares, least of all me.   
we listen now for the tolling of some great bell that will end it all, some great being that will shake loose the burghers
some great hand that would unseat a king. but it has yet to come. and it may never.

I am a man, a beggar, sometimes a thief. I was once to be an astrologer, i went to school for a time, but it doesn't matter now.
I was born in the west, but i am not a wester. i can swing the club, sure, but not like the westerns.

there's a storm coming to lurzig, a storm as powerful as ever seen and it'll shake this town loose, shake its foundations and rattle them walls.
