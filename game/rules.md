## Combat structure
### Attacks, step by step
1. Attacker moves into melee range.  
   * e.g. The vampire swordfighter moves into melee range of the monster.  
2. Attacker picks an attack ability to use.
    * e.g. The vampire chooses to use *Vicious Stab*.
3. Defender looks up their Melee Defense.
    * e.g. **The Great Ram of Shamborga** has a Melee Defense of -1. (this isn't the best, he's a big fella)
4. Attacker determines their chance of success by modifying the success chance by the defense of the opponent.
    * e.g. *Vicious stab* as a success chance of 4+. The minus 1 from the melee defense makes it a 3+. The Ram is easier to hit than other targets. 
5.  Attacker pays the dice cost, if any, for the attack.
    * e.g. *Vicious Stab* is cost 0.
6.  Attacker chooses how many dice they will roll for the attack from their selection of attack and wild dice.
    * e.g. *Vicious stab* has a allocation of 1-3. The vampire chooses 3.
7.  Attacker rolls attack dice.
    * e.g. The results are 2, 5, 6.
8.  Attacker compares the dice results to the attack's chance of success. These are **hits**. Those not in the success range are **misses**.
    * e.g. *Vicious stab* has a chance of success of 3+ (after being modified by defense). 2 is a miss. 5 and 6 are hits.
9.  Attacker informs the defender of the attack type. 
    * e.g. *Vicious Stab* is an attack against the **Armor** of the opponent.
10. Attacker informs the defender of the **Power** of the attack.
    * e.g. *Vicious Stab* has a power of +2.
11. The defender looks up the resistance corresponding to the attack type and modifies it by the Power of the attack.
    * e.g. The Ram has an armor of 5+. The power of the attack brings that to 7+.
12. The defender rolls a die for each hit from the attack, comparing them to the modified armor value.
    * e.g. The Ram rolls 2 die. 1, 7. The 7 is an armor save, the 1 is a failure.
13. The attacker informs the defender of the damage of the attack.
    * e.g. Vicious stab has a damage value of 1.
14. The defender suffers wounds equal to the number of hits x the damage of the weapon
    * e.g. The ram suffers 1 wound.
15. The defender checks to see if they have 0 or less wounds. If so, they are fall prone and gain the "Dying" condition.
