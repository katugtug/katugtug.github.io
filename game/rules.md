## Warband building
Models have classes: Defender, Brute, Support, Attacker
Defenders guard others and provide them bonuses.
Brutes take lots of damage and deal lots of damage, but offer no support to others.
Support force multiplies, based on leadership, healing, adding attack or defense bonuses.

## Model Activation
A model can do 2 movements and 1 action. 

### Movements
- Move the model's movement distance.
- Use a movement ability (e.g. Vampire's turn to mist ability)

## Combat 
Each character has dice in 4 categories
    - Attack dice (red 1d10s) - Each attack has its own attack values, what is considered a success.
      - Melee Attack 3+
      - Ranged Attack 5+
      - Magic Attack 7+
    - Defense dice (blue 1d10s) - Roll simultaneously with attack dice. Defender wagers the dice used from his pool.
      - Defensive dice cancel attack dice of equal or less number.
    - Armor Dice (purple d10's) - Rolled to resist attacks that have landed.
      - No armor dice means automatic wound.
      - 
    - Movement dice (yellow 1d10s)
      - Used for extra movement. Spend to gain movement.

## Combat structure
### Melee
Attacker moves into melee range.
    e.g. The vampire swordfighter moves into melee range of the monster.
Attacker picks an attack ability to use.
    e.g. The vampire chooses to use *Vicious Stab*.
Attacker pays the dice cost, if any, for the attack.
    e.g. *Vicious Stab* is cost 0.
Attacker chooses how many dice they will roll for the attack from their selection of attack and wild dice.
    e.g. *Vicious stab* has a allocation of 1-3. The vampire chooses 3.
Attacker rolls attack dice.
    e.g. The results are 2, 5, 6.
Attacker compares the dice results to the attack's chance of success. These are **hits**. Those not in the success range are **misses**.
    e.g. *Vicious stab* has a chance of success of 4+. 2 is a miss. 5 and 6 are hits.
Attacker informs the defender of his accuracy. 
    e.g. *Vicious Stab* has an accuracy of +1. 

Defender looks up their Melee Defense.
    e.g. **The Great Ram of Shamborga** has a Melee Defense of 6+. (this isn't the best, he's a big fella)
Defender modifies his Melee Defense by the Accuracy of the attack by increasing the bottom of the range by 1.
    e.g. The great ram increases his melee defense to 7+ to resist this attack. (this is a bad thing, accuracy decreases the ram's chance to dodge.)
Defender chooses how many dice they will roll to resist the attack. 
    e.g. The ram decides to roll 1 of his defense dice and 2 of his wild dice to try to resist.
The defender rolls their defense dice, trying to roll above their Melee Defense. A successful defensive roll is called a dodge.
    e.g. The results are a 1, 5, 7. Two failures and a success. 
The defender removes a number of attack hits equal to the number of the defensive dodges..
    e.g. 2 - 1 means the attacker now has only hit 1 time. The ram dodged one of the hits.

Attacker informs the defender of the attack type. 
    e.g. *Vicious Stab* is an attack against the **Armor** of the opponent.
Attacker informs the defender of the **Power** of the attack.
    e.g. *Vicious Stab* has a power of +2.
The defender looks up the defense corresponding to the attack type and modifies it by the Power of the attack.
    e.g. The Ram has an armor of 5+. The power of the attack brings that to 7+.
The defender rolls a die for each hit from the attack, comparing them to the modified armor value.
    e.g. The Ram rolls 2 die. 1, 7. The 7 is an armor save, the 1 is a failure.

The attacker informs the defender of the damage of the attack.
    e.g. Vicious stab has a damage value of 1.
The defender suffers wounds equal to the number of hits x the damage of the weapon
    e.g. The ram suffers 1 wound.

## Design Notes

###  Attackers vs Defenses vs Resistances
Good attackers should succeed 70% of the time. (4+)
Good defenders should succeed 50% of the time. (6+)
Good resisters should succeed 30% of the time. (8+)
