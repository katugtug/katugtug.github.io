# Combat rules revised.

To Hit:

Melee Skill             0 is base. 
Ranged Skill            
Arcane Skill

playtest ranges. +3 being normal skill I think.

Melee Defense           
Projectile Defense
Arcane Defense

Attack selects number of dice to roll and selects attack.
Defender knows the dice bid of attacker and the attack used.
Defender selects number of dice to use.

Advantage is determined - that is the difference between the attackers attack skill and the defenders defense skill.
Either the defender or the attacker or neither has the advantage.

For ease, playtest assigning this as a modifier to either, or just to attacker or defender and see which is easier.

Defender and attacker roll together. Defender cancels out attackers dice by rolling equal when advantage is accounted for.

Any attacks that get through are hits. An opponent must roll equal to the power of the attack to counter it. 

Any attacks that get through deal the damage of the attack.

## Defenses and Attack types
Armor
- Basic attacks with all melee and ranged weapons.

Agility
- Making free strikes
- Avoiding falling damage
- Tripping attacks 

Body
- Charging
- Poison
- Fire
- Avoiding fatigue
 
Spirit
- Morale tests
- Fear effects
- Resisting magic.

## Movement
1 die to move base movement. Can spend 2 / turn, double move.
Charging: Pick target. Test Body 8 to charge. If successful, move 1d5 extra inches towards target. If not in melee, turn ends. If in melee, get +1 to attack rolls this turn.

## Fatigue
At the end of the round, if a model has more dice unspent than it's Fatigue Limit, it gains a Fatigue token for each point over. Each fatigue token gives -1 to all rolls.
If a model has equal to or less than its Fatigue Limit, the model removes all Fatigue tokens and is no longed Fatigued.
Fatigue Limit starts at 0 for light armor. A light armored (or unarmored) model can spend all of its dice without fatigue being an issue.
Heavier armor may provide protection, but limits exertion. A heavily armored model will find fatigue quickly sapping their abilities.

## Powers
Basic melee: melee vs melee, POW 10 vs Armor, damage 1
Basic ranged: ranged vs projectile, POW 10 vs Armor, damage 1

Regenerate Flesh: magic skill, 1 friendly target, TN 8, heals 1 / success
Iron Skin - magic skill, 1 friendly target, TN 8, gain +2 ARM for x rounds where x equals successes.
Cloak of Fear: magic skill, 1 friendly target, TN 8, gain Terrifying (8) for x rounds where x equals successes.
Inspiration: magic skill, all friendly models in 5", TN 8, remove a fatigue token from each target.

Fireball: magic vs projectile, POW 10 vs Reflexes, causes Fire (8), damage 1
Confuse the Mind: magic vs magic, POW 8 vs Spirit, damage 1 - causes Confusion (10)

## Ranged attack damage fall off.
Every weapon has a falloff. The POW of the attack falls over -1 for every full fall off distance.




## Equipment
Polearms and Long spears grant First Strike. 
Battle Axes grant +2 POW vs Armor.
Swords grant +1 melee skill.

## Rules
First Strike
A ready model with First Strike can choose to resolve the Counter Attack before the normal attack. This model must be eligible to make a counter attack, as normal.

Ready
A model is ready if it not suffering any status effect and is not engaged.

Confusion (Spirit x) - status effect
At the beginning of a model's activation, test (X). If successful, discard confusion. Otherwise, choose a target from all available targets at random and spend 1 die making a basic attack against the target. This is treated as a normal attack, allow counter attacks etc.

Fatigued - status effect - stackable up to 3 tokens
This model gets -1 to all die rolls..

Fire (Body x) - status effect
At the end of the round, test Body 8. On success, status is removed. On failure, suffer 1 wound.

Terrifying (Spirit x)
Enemy models engaged with this model must test X or go into Wavering state.

Wavering - status effect
This model cannot activate. At the end of the round, this model must pass a Spirit 8. If they succeed, they are no longer Wavering.
If the test fails, the model must move 2x movement value towards away from enemies. This model is no longer Wavering and is now In Retreat.

In Retreat - status effect
This model cannot activate. At the end of the round, this model moves 2x movement value away from enemies.
