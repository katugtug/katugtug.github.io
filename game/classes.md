# Classes 

In this game, you can build a character by selecting character classes and spending experience points. In a matched play game, you would have equal experience points. In a campaign, you gain additional experience to level up your characters on campaign.

The system has a goal to provide a satisfying facsimile of any character from fantasy and related fiction.

The other goal is provide a workable, in universe rendering of most fantasy miniatures.

Classes have tags which can indicate a role: Support, Attack, Defend
Or a type of fiction: Historical medieval, steampunk, high fantasy, low fantasy, others.
Or a type of class; Specialist, Profession, etc.
